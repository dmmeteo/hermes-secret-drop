# `npm start` runs `node src/main.js` — byte-identical to the old CMD. That
# collision is not theoretical: a host-side `pkill -f "node src/main.js"` aimed
# at a local dev broker killed this container twice on 2026-08-02. Nothing reads
# the marker; it exists to be seen in `ps` and to make a careless pattern miss.
