# Hermes Drop

Ask for a secret without putting it in the chat.

Hermes Drop gives a [Hermes](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) agent a
way to request private text or up to five files from the person it is talking to:
it posts a short-lived link into **the conversation it is already in**, the user
chooses text or files in one web form, the browser encrypts the payload, and the
agent is woken when it arrives. The plaintext and file bytes never appear in a chat
message.

Two pieces, both self-hosted by you:

- a **broker** — a small Node.js service behind your own HTTPS reverse proxy, which
  mints links, receives sealed envelopes and hands the plaintext to exactly one
  local claim; and
- a **Hermes plugin plus stock skill command** — which provide `/drop`, the
  `request_private_input`, `claim_private_input` and `send_private_output` tools, and
  the durable bookkeeping that survives a restart.

Both directions: the user can send Hermes a secret without typing it in the chat,
and Hermes can hand the user one the same way.

## Stock Hermes integration

Hermes Drop runs on released, unmodified Hermes. `/drop [prompt]` is a stock skill
command, so it enters the normal authenticated agent path before a Drop tool runs.
The plugin registers only three origin-bound tools and an observation hook; it
registers no slash command and requires no Hermes core patch.

## Features

- **`/drop [prompt]`** — one semantic skill command. Empty means the user wants to
  provide private input; a prompt lets the agent infer inbound or outbound intent.
  There is no TTL, destination, underscore or hyphenated command variant.
- **`request_private_input`** and **`claim_private_input`** — the inbound operation.
- **`send_private_output`** — the other direction. Hermes hands the user a secret it
  holds through a one-time link and a 3-digit code instead of writing it in the chat.
  The values arrive as **labelled fields** — login, password, API key, URL, note — and
  the page renders however many there are, each with its own Copy button, with the
  sensitive ones masked until the user asks. Ask it to `generate` a password and the
  broker draws it: the value never enters a tool argument, a model turn or a
  transcript at all.
- **One universal form.** The existing `/drop` and `request_private_input` flow
  creates one link where the sender chooses either private text or up to 5 files
  totaling 42 MiB. There is no separate file command or file-only link.
- **A form that says what it wants.** A request may carry a short non-secret
  description ("Upload the two config files for the staging deployment"), an
  optional heading, and — when the requester genuinely knows — a payload mode and
  an exact file count. The page then shows only the controls that apply and counts
  the files against the expectation, with the broker enforcing both. All of it is
  optional: ask for nothing and the universal both-lanes form is what the user
  gets, unchanged. The copy is untrusted display data — written as text, never as
  markup — and it can change nothing about the link's lane, limits or expiry.
- **Private file spool.** Files are encrypted together in one HDROP2 container,
  claimed over the private framed socket, and atomically published as `0600` files
  beneath a `0700` spool. Hermes receives sanitized metadata and local paths only;
  file bytes never enter the model context, `state.db`, FTS or session logs.
- **Origin-bound by construction.** Neither the command nor the tool schema has a
  destination field — no `platform`, `chat_id`, `channel`, `thread_id` or `target`
  at any depth. A model that cannot express a destination cannot pick the wrong
  one. The link goes to the conversation the request came from, verified against
  the gateway's own session context, or it is refused.
- **One-shot browser encryption.** RFC 9180 HPKE (`DHKEM(P-256, HKDF-SHA256)` /
  `HKDF-SHA256` / `AES-256-GCM`) sealed in the browser with `crypto.subtle`.
- **One claim.** The payload is destroyed as it is read; a second claim gets the
  same generic unavailable answer as a wrong capability.
- **Not written to `state.db`.** The claimed plaintext never enters Hermes'
  durable session store, FTS index, session log or backups — only a placeholder
  does. See [Durable sanitization](#durable-sanitization).
- **Durable journal and reconciler.** A gateway restart mid-drop does not orphan a
  live link or a waiting status message.
- **One chat message, edited in place**, through three fixed states — waiting,
  received, expired. The received and expired states carry no URL, capability or
  id. No per-minute edits: the countdown is a platform-rendered relative
  timestamp.
- **A platform-native card, so state reads at a glance.** Every notice on a
  verified platform is a blockquote card: Discord and Telegram each draw it with
  their own native quote rendering, and the card is preserved by the lifecycle
  edit rather than collapsing into loose prose. Four classes are distinguishable
  by their leading glyph — 🔒 requested, ✓ received, ✕ expired, 🔑 outbound drop.
  Discord accent colours are *not* used: they exist only on embeds, and a plugin
  cannot attach one through the supported adapter interface on either the send or
  the edit path.
- **Discord and Telegram.** An unsupported platform is refused by name, never
  degraded to a plain notice and never redirected. `plain` — used by the admin
  CLI and the Claude Code client, never in chat — stays markup-free and uncarded.
- **One reveal, and the page says so.** An outbound drop opens once: after a
  successful reveal the payload is destroyed and the link is spent. The page explains
  what it is, counts down its own expiry, and states plainly that it cannot be opened
  again. A `GET` or `HEAD` never consumes it, so an unfurler, a scanner or an
  antivirus fetching the link first costs nothing.
- **Bounded, atomic payload validation.** The outbound payload is composed by a model
  and rendered to a person, so it is checked against a strict schema — safe labels, a
  closed type set, bounded field count, per-value and total sizes — and a refusal
  mints nothing at all. The page writes text nodes only; no payload string is ever
  interpolated into markup, and the chat message quotes nothing from the payload but
  its field count.
- **64 KiB** maximum plaintext inbound, **2 KiB** outbound, **30 minutes** default
  lifetime (1–60 configurable per drop).

## How it works

```
  user types /drop, or the model calls request_private_input
        │
        ▼
  plugin resolves the ORIGIN (platform, profile, chat, thread)
  and verifies it against the gateway's bound session context ──► refuse if unverified
        │
        ▼
  broker mints:  handoff_id · 128-bit capability · per-drop P-256 key pair
                 stores only SHA-256(capability); the private key never leaves memory
        │
        ▼
  plugin posts ONE message into that same conversation:  https://host/#<capability>
        │                                                          ▲
        │                                        capability is in the URL fragment,
        │                                        so it never reaches the request
        │                                        target, access logs or Referer
        ▼
  browser  GET / ──► one static page
           POST /api/metadata  (capability in a header) ──► public key, suite, deadline
           POST /api/submit    (one HPKE SealBase envelope)
        │
        ▼
  broker opens the envelope, atomically moves pending ──► submitted,
  drops the key pair, and wakes the waiting plugin (nothing polls)
        │
        ▼
  plugin edits the SAME message to "received", then claims ONCE over a
  0600 Unix socket; plaintext reaches the model as a tool result
```

`info = "hermes-handoff/v1" ‖ 0x00 ‖ version ‖ suite_id ‖ handoff_id ‖ SHA-256(capability)`
is bound into the AEAD, so an envelope cannot be replayed into another drop,
version or suite — it fails at decryption.

### State machine

```
pending ──submit(AEAD ok)──► submitted ──claim──► claimed (receipt only, no payload)
   │                             │                         │
   │   3 AEAD failures           │                         │
   └── expiry / broker restart ──┴─────────────────────────┴──► destroyed
```

An AEAD failure does not consume a drop; three of them destroy it. Only a
`pending` drop can reach the AEAD, so that is the only state the failure budget
can destroy — expiry and restart apply to all three. Retries are idempotent by
envelope digest: re-POSTing the *same* envelope returns the same receipt for the
rest of the lifetime and never delivers twice, while a *different* envelope
against a consumed drop gets the unavailable answer.

The full machine — every state, every edge, what each seam answers in each state,
and what deletion is and is not worth — is stated in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#handoff-lifecycle-and-deletion-guarantees) and pinned by
`test/lifecycle-fsm.test.js`.

### The other direction: Hermes hands the user a secret

```
  the model calls send_private_output with labelled fields
        │
        ▼
  plugin resolves and verifies the SAME origin, then validates the payload
  against a bounded schema ──► refuse, and nothing is minted at all
        │
        ▼
  broker encrypts the payload, stores the ciphertext, DROPS the AES key
  (it is handed back inside the URL fragment and nowhere else),
  and stores HMAC(random key, code) — never the code itself
        │
        ▼
  plugin posts ONE message into that same conversation:
        https://host/#r.<capability>.<key>   plus a 3-digit code on its own line
        │
        ▼
  browser  GET / ──► one static page, and a preview consumes nothing
           POST /api/reveal/metadata ──► deadline, attempts left
           POST /api/reveal/claim    (the code the person typed, one claim id)
           ── decrypt locally with the key from the fragment ──
           POST /api/reveal/ack      ──► the broker destroys the payload
        │
        ▼
  the page renders each field with its label, a Copy button, and a mask on
  the sensitive ones. It cannot be opened again.
```

Three digits is a **human-presence and anti-preview gate**, not authentication: the
link and the code travel in the same conversation. What it buys is that an unfurler,
a scanner or an antivirus fetching the URL cannot spend the drop. Three wrong codes
destroy the payload — denial of delivery is deliberately preferred over allowing
online brute force.

The broker is the one party that cannot read an outbound payload: it generates the
AES key, uses it once, hands it back in the fragment and zero-fills it. Ask for a
`generate`d value and the broker draws it too, so for a freshly created password the
plaintext exists only between that call and the reveal — never in a tool argument, a
model turn or a transcript.

### Durable sanitization

A claimed secret arrives as a tool result, and Hermes persists a tool result
*before* the model ever sees it: `agent/tool_executor.py` appends the result
string to the message list and flushes it straight into `state.db`, the
`messages_fts*` index and the JSON session log, and only then builds the API
request. There is one string at that moment and it is both the durable row and
the wire, so no single seam can keep the plaintext out of one and in the other.

Hermes Drop splits them:

- the plugin substitutes an opaque ASCII placeholder —
  `[hermes-drop:secret:<32 hex>]` — into the tool result **before** it becomes a
  string, so nothing downstream of the plugin ever holds the plaintext. This
  depends on no Hermes hook, deliberately: `transform_tool_result` is
  `has_hook`-gated and fails open, which is not a property to hang a password on.
- `llm_request` middleware puts the plaintext back into the *provider payload*,
  which Hermes hands to middleware as a deep copy. The persisted message dicts
  are never touched.

By the time middleware runs, Hermes has already translated the tool result into
whatever the active `api_mode` speaks, and the placeholder sits in a different
key in each — `messages[].content` for `chat_completions`, a `tool_result` part's
`content` for `anthropic_messages`, a `function_call_output`'s `output` under
`input` for `codex_responses`, and `toolResult.content[].text` for
`bedrock_converse`. Rather than enumerate those, the substitution walks the
payload structurally, so a transport added later is covered too. Tests build all
four shapes with Hermes' own converters, so a change to any of them fails the
suite instead of quietly stranding a secret on the durable side.

Both halves fail closed. A middleware error is isolated and logged by Hermes,
leaving the placeholder on the wire; a vault that cannot hold the secret turns
the claim into `internal_error`. The failure mode is a model that cannot read
the secret — never a secret in `state.db`.

The placeholder outlives the plaintext in the transcript, so it is bound to the
session that claimed it and resolved for no other, and the plaintext lapses from
memory after **15 minutes**. Past that the model reads the placeholder and is
told to ask for a new drop.

`llm_request` middleware is a supported plugin API
(`ctx.register_middleware`); no Hermes core patch is involved. A Hermes without
it still loads the plugin — the claim then returns a placeholder the model
cannot resolve, and the plugin says so in `agent.log`.

### Declarative forms

A request can be an **ordered combination of fields** rather than one box: a username and
a password, a named API key, or a release tag with two independent groups of log files.
Each field has a stable id, a concrete label and one of five types (`text`, `email`,
`textarea`, `secret`, `files`), and the values come back keyed by those ids.

It is an engine, not a set of presets — `docs/DECLARATIVE_FORM_ENGINE.md` is the canon.
Two consequences worth knowing before you use it:

- **a `secret` field requires an authorized no-model consumer, and none ships.** The
  whole submission goes to that consumer and the model gets a value-free receipt. With
  nothing installed — which is every deployment today — a secret form is refused at mint
  rather than asking someone for a password Drop could not deliver privately;
- **everything else works normally.** Text, email and multiline values come back to the
  model keyed by id (redacted into durable state exactly as a claimed secret always was),
  and file groups are spooled exactly as files have always been.

## Threat model

**Trusted with the plaintext, by design:** the host running the broker, its root
user, the broker process, your Hermes gateway process, and the model handling the
conversation. Browser-side encryption is defence in depth against TLS-terminating
hops and request-body logging *in front of* the broker — not protection from any
of those principals.

**What it is designed to stop:**

| | |
|---|---|
| The secret in chat history | The plaintext is never sent as a message, on any platform. |
| The secret in URLs and logs | The capability rides in the URL `#fragment`; the plaintext is never in a request target, an access log, a `Referer` header or an HTTP response. |
| A link landing in the wrong conversation | No destination is expressible by the model; the origin is resolved and then verified, or refused. |
| Replay into another drop | The capability hash, drop id, version and suite are bound into the HPKE `info`. |
| A second reader | One claim, then a payload-free receipt. |
| A payload consumed on behalf of a reader that could not receive it | The claiming client states how large a response line it can read; the broker sizes the answer against that *before* retiring anything, and refuses instead. |
| Guessing a link | 128 bits of CSPRNG entropy, a 30-minute default lifetime, a uniform unavailable answer for every wrong guess, and nothing persisted to attack offline. |
| A stolen bot token editing history | The status message carries no capability once it leaves the waiting state. |
| The claimed secret in `state.db` | The tool result Hermes persists carries a placeholder, not the plaintext. The plaintext is held in gateway memory and substituted into the provider request only. See [Durable sanitization](#durable-sanitization). |

**Accepted residual risks:**

- **A stolen live URL can submit first.** Bounded by 128-bit entropy, the lifetime
  and one-shot consumption. The link is delivered through your chat platform, so
  anyone who can read that conversation can use it — which is the intended
  audience, and the reason the drop is origin-bound.
- **The claimed plaintext reaches the model's context.** The model is a trusted
  principal, and what it does next is not confined: if it echoes the secret into
  a reply or passes it as an argument to another tool, *that* is persisted like
  any other model output. What is no longer persisted is the claim itself — see
  below.
- **Authenticated HTTPS is load-bearing.** It authenticates the JavaScript that
  performs the encryption; `crypto.subtle` only exists in a secure context.

## Limitations

- **Not end-to-end encryption.** See above. The broker can decrypt.
- **Not independently audited**, and neither is the HPKE library. See the warning
  at the top.
- **Not hardened deletion.** "Destroyed" means dropped from an in-memory map and a
  best-effort zero-fill. Nothing is claimed about swap, core dumps or snapshots.
- **A broker restart destroys every pending drop.** Deliberate: the per-drop
  private keys are never persisted, so a restarted process cannot decrypt an old
  ciphertext. Live links stop working and their status messages are reconciled to
  expired.
- **The claim response has a size ceiling.** The plugin reads a claim response up
  to 1 MiB, which is ~783 KB of plaintext after base64. The shipped broker default
  is 64 KiB, an order of magnitude clear of it, and a test pins that. If you raise
  `HANDOFF_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` past the ceiling, a payload above it is *refused*
  rather than delivered — `response_too_large`, with the drop still intact and
  still claimable by `handoff-admin claim`, which reads an unbounded line. The
  plugin warns in `agent.log` at create time when a broker advertises a cap it
  cannot read back, because a refusal still costs the user a round trip. The
  remedy is to bring `HANDOFF_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` back under ~783 KB; the
  plugin's own reader ceiling is a constant and cannot be raised to meet it.
- **An old broker cannot refuse before consuming.** The pre-consumption size check
  arrived with control protocol 2 (broker 0.5.0). A protocol 1 broker accepts the
  `max_response_bytes` field, ignores it, and destroys an oversized payload as it
  answers, exactly as 0.4.0 did. The plugin does not assume otherwise: every
  `create` response carries `protocol_version` (absent means 1), and the plugin
  reads it rather than its own version. What it does with the answer:

  | broker | `HANDOFF_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` | plugin |
  |---|---|---|
  | protocol ≥ 2 | ≤ ~783 KB (default 64 KiB) | proceeds, silent |
  | protocol ≥ 2 | above ~783 KB | proceeds, warns — an oversized claim is refused, never destroyed |
  | protocol 1 | ≤ ~783 KB (default 64 KiB) | **proceeds**, warns once about the version gap; nothing this broker accepts is too large to read back, so it is exactly as safe as 0.4.0 was |
  | protocol 1 | above ~783 KB | **refuses the drop** with `broker_too_old` |

  Only the last row is refused, and it is refused *before* the link is posted: no
  message, no journal entry, no waiter, and nobody is asked for a secret. The
  minted handoff is never submitted to and simply lapses at its TTL — there is
  nothing to recover with `handoff-admin claim`. Operator remedy: upgrade the
  broker to 0.5.0 or newer, **or** lower `HANDOFF_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` under
  ~783 KB. Either one clears it; the `agent.log` line names both with the numbers.
- **A delivered claim can go unrecorded.** The broker destroys its copy as it
  answers, so `claimed_at` is written after the plugin already holds the only
  copy. If that write fails the secret is still returned, with a note, and the
  failure is an `ERROR` in `agent.log`; the journal understates what happened
  until the entry lapses. The alternative — failing the claim — would destroy a
  secret the system had already successfully delivered. The visible consequence is
  bounded: an entry that stays `received` with no `claimed_at` is re-announced by
  the reconciler after the 15-minute grace, up to `MAX_ANNOUNCE_ATTEMPTS` (5)
  in total, so the model may be told again to claim a drop it already claimed —
  and each of those claims is answered `unavailable` by the broker's receipt.
- **Durable sanitization does not confine the model or the wire.** Three
  exposures survive it, all verified rather than assumed:
  - anything the model *does* with the secret — echoing it into a reply, passing
    it as a tool argument — is persisted normally. The model is trusted.
  - the plaintext is on the wire to your model provider. That is the point of the
    feature.
  - anything that reads the request *after* middleware sees the plaintext:
    Hermes' `pre_api_request` hook (so an observability plugin such as langfuse
    would ship it), **NeMo Relay** (which wraps the provider call itself, so every
    Relay interceptor and exporter in that profile sees the post-substitution
    body), and `HERMES_DUMP_REQUESTS=1` (which writes it to disk). None is on by
    default; do not enable any of them on a gateway that handles drops.
- **A claimed secret lapses after 15 minutes**, enforced by a timer rather than
  checked on the next call in. Past that the transcript keeps the placeholder and
  the model must ask for a new drop. Claim then use; do not claim and sit on it.
- **The memory cap is process-global.** At most 4 live secrets per session and 32
  across the gateway. The per-session cap means a busy conversation evicts its own
  oldest first, but the global one is shared: past it another session's secret can
  be evicted early, leaving its model with an unresolvable placeholder.
- **No outbound file transfer** and no multi-recipient drops. Outbound is for a
  short private value; outbound file sharing is explicitly out of scope.
- **A drop cannot be opened during a wake turn** if the conversation's lane was
  rewritten in between: the plugin refuses rather than guessing, and the user types
  `/drop`. Claiming is unaffected.
- **Single broker process.** State is in-memory; there is no clustering story.

## Quick start (local, no Hermes)

Runs the broker on your own machine and drives it with the admin CLI — enough to
see the whole loop.

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify        # build the browser bundle, run every test, run the smoke test
npm start &           # broker on http://127.0.0.1:8787

node bin/handoff-admin.mjs create --ttl 1800   # prints the URL
# open it, paste something, press Send
node bin/handoff-admin.mjs claim <drop-id>     # prints the plaintext, once
node bin/handoff-admin.mjs claim <drop-id>     # exits 1: unavailable
```

The admin CLI is the local operator path; there is no admin HTTP endpoint.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create [--ttl <s>] [--notice] [--platform <discord\|telegram\|plain>]` | Mints a drop. `--notice` prints the ready-to-post waiting message instead of the bare URL. An unlisted platform exits `2`, never falls back. |
| `await <id> [--timeout <s>]` | Blocks until the submission and prints one non-secret line. Exit `0` submitted, `1` transport failure, `2` usage, `3` unavailable. |
| `claim <id> [--wait <s>]` | Prints the plaintext to stdout, once. |
| `notice <received\|expired>` | Prints the content the waiting message is edited into. Needs no broker. |

## Deploying the broker

The broker expects to sit behind a reverse proxy that terminates HTTPS. The
supplied `compose.yml` targets [Traefik](https://traefik.io/) on an existing
external Docker network named `proxy`, publishing no port of its own; adapt the
labels if you use something else.

**1. Set your public hostname and socket directory.** Copy `.env.example` to
`.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# HANDOFF_PUBLIC_HOST=drop.example.com
# HANDOFF_SOCKET_DIR=/srv/hermes-drop/run
```

**2. Create the control-socket directory yourself, before first start.** The
control socket lives on a host directory so a local process — your Hermes gateway
— can reach the admin path without `docker exec`. Docker would create a missing
bind-mount source as `root:root`, which the broker refuses to serve out of:

```bash
install -d -m 700 -o 1000 -g 1000 /srv/hermes-drop/run
bin/install-hermes-drop.sh --preflight        # read-only: validates, changes nothing
```

**3. Build and start.**

```bash
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
docker compose exec handoff node bin/handoff-admin.mjs create
```

`build && up -d` is a **recreate**, and that matters: a bare `docker restart`
reuses the existing container, so it keeps both the old image *and* the old
environment — a container created when the default lifetime was 600 seconds keeps
600 forever, however often it is restarted and whatever `compose.yml` says today.

> **Never clean up a broker with a pattern kill.** A container's argv appears
> verbatim on the *host* process table, so `pkill -f "node src/main.js"` run from a
> checkout reaches into the running container and takes it down. The container
> runs `node /app/src/main.js --role=handoff-broker-container` so a careless
> pattern misses it, but the rule stands: kill the exact PID, or
> `docker compose stop`.

The container runs as a pinned `1000:1000` with a read-only root filesystem, all
capabilities dropped, and a `tmpfs` for `/tmp`.

## Installing the Hermes plugin

The installer never guesses a profile. Every invocation names its target.

```bash
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" bin/install-hermes-drop.sh install
```

That symlinks this checkout into `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/hermes-drop`, installs the
stock command at `$HERMES_HOME/skills/drop`, and adds `hermes-drop` to
`plugins.enabled` in that profile's `config.yaml`. The config edit
is surgical — validated by a YAML parser, applied as whole-line changes, written by
atomic rename — so your comments and formatting survive, and an ambiguous layout is
**refused** with the file untouched rather than guessed at.

| Flag | Use |
|---|---|
| `install` | Symlink the plugin and skill. The repo stays the single source of truth. |
| `--copy` | Pin versioned copies instead, for hosts where the profile must not depend on this checkout. |
| `--uninstall` | Remove the managed plugin, skill, and that one `plugins.enabled` entry. |
| `--preflight` | Validate the host control-socket directory. Read-only. |

Then point the plugin at the broker's socket, in that profile's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  entries:
    hermes-drop:
      control_socket: /srv/hermes-drop/run/control.sock
```

or with `HERMES_DROP_CONTROL_SOCKET`. The default is `/run/handoff/control.sock`.
An explicitly empty value switches the tools off. **Do not set
`plugins.entries.hermes-drop.allow_tool_override`** — Drop registers new tool names
and must never replace a built-in; the installer never writes it.

The installer restarts nothing. Plugin discovery and command registration run at
gateway start, so **restart your gateway** when you are ready.

### Multiple profiles

Everything is profile-scoped through `HERMES_HOME`; nothing falls back to
`~/.hermes`.

```bash
HERMES_HOME=/srv/profiles/work    bin/install-hermes-drop.sh install
HERMES_HOME=/srv/profiles/staging bin/install-hermes-drop.sh install
```

Each profile gets its own plugin and skill links, `plugins.enabled` entry, and `control_socket`
setting, and its own journal at `$HERMES_HOME/state/hermes-drop`. Profiles can
share one broker — a drop is bound to its conversation, not to a profile — or you
can run a broker per profile with a socket directory each. Stock Hermes binds the
authenticated turn identity before the skill invokes an origin-bound tool.

If PyYAML is not importable from the interpreter on your `PATH`, name one:

```bash
HERMES_DROP_PYTHON="$HERMES_HOME/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python" \
HERMES_HOME="$HERMES_HOME" bin/install-hermes-drop.sh install
```

## Verifying an install

```bash
npm run verify          # broker build/tests/smoke + the complete plugin suite
```

Then, against the live pair:

```bash
# the socket the gateway will use is reachable and correctly owned
HANDOFF_SOCKET_DIR=/srv/hermes-drop/run bin/install-hermes-drop.sh --preflight

# the broker answers on it
docker compose exec handoff node bin/handoff-admin.mjs create --ttl 60

# the plugin is enabled and its tools registered (after a gateway restart)
hermes plugins list
```

Finally, type `/drop` in a Discord or Telegram conversation with your agent. The
link must arrive **in that conversation** — that is the property worth checking by
hand.

## Upgrading

```bash
git pull
npm ci && npm run verify
docker compose build && docker compose up -d      # broker: recreate, never restart
```

A symlinked plugin needs no reinstall — restart the gateway to pick up the new
code. A `--copy` install does: re-run `bin/install-hermes-drop.sh --copy`.

Run the plugin suite against the exact upstream stable candidate before upgrading.

Treat a `@hpke/core` bump as a change that must re-run `test/hpke-vectors.test.js`
before it carries a real secret.

## Uninstalling

```bash
HERMES_HOME="$HOME/.hermes" bin/install-hermes-drop.sh --uninstall
docker compose down
```

`--uninstall` is complete on its own. It removes the plugin directory and exactly
one `plugins.enabled` entry — it does **not** restore a config snapshot, because
that would discard every unrelated change you made since installing. Any
`config.yaml.hermes-drop-backup-*` files are left as an audit trail; delete them
yourself. Nothing is restarted; a running gateway keeps the tools registered until
it restarts.

The installer leaves unrelated skills and config entries untouched.

## Standalone Claude Code command

This checkout includes a project-scoped native command at
`.claude/commands/drop.md`; it works directly in Claude Code without Hermes ACP or
MCP. The command calls `bin/claude-drop`, which talks to the same local broker
socket. Do not copy it into a user-wide command directory unless you also provide
a stable helper path intentionally—the shipped command fails closed outside this
project.

The Claude boundary is deliberately narrower than Hermes:

- inbound **text** is materialized into a private `0600` file; Claude must pass the
  path only to a non-logging consumer and then clean it up;
- inbound files are unsupported, because the standalone client does not implement
  the framed file claim and must not mint a form it cannot safely consume;
- outbound broker-generated credentials are supported without plaintext entering
  the transcript;
- relaying existing outbound plaintext is unsupported because a Bash/tool argument
  would persist it.

On a desktop, the capability notice is copied to the clipboard. On headless Herdr,
it is written to a private `0600` file and only that path reaches command output.
There is no chat-delivery fallback.

## Configuration

### Broker

> **Outbound drops now work end to end.** The reveal page ships in the bundle, and
> the Hermes plugin registers `send_private_output` alongside the two inbound tools:
> Hermes posts a link and a 3-digit code into the conversation it was asked in, the
> user types the code, and the page renders the labelled values with a Copy button on
> each. What remains a real limitation is **a page reload between the code and the
> copy costs the secret** — see "A page reload costs the secret" in `SECURITY.md`. The
> four `HANDOFF_OUTBOUND_*` / `HANDOFF_MAX_OUTBOUND_*` keys below govern it.

| Env var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HANDOFF_PORT` / `HANDOFF_HOST` | `8787` / `0.0.0.0` | `0` picks an ephemeral port. |
| `HANDOFF_BASE_URL` | derived from the listening port | Absolute base for printed URLs. |
| `HANDOFF_TTL_SECONDS` | `1800` | Deployment policy; never client-supplied. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | Ceiling for `create --ttl`. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` | `65536` | Enforced by the broker. See the claim-ceiling limitation above before raising it. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `131072` | Request-body ceiling; also bounded at the proxy. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_AEAD_FAILURES` | `3` | Destroys the drop after this many. Also the budget for container-validation failures on a file drop. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_FILES` | `5` | Files per file drop. **May only be lowered**; a higher value is refused at startup. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_FILE_BYTES` | `44040192` (42 MiB) | Per-file cap on a file drop; the total below stays authoritative. May only be lowered. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_FILE_TOTAL_BYTES` | `44040192` (42 MiB) | Total file plaintext per file drop. May only be lowered. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_LIVE_FILE_BYTES` | `176186556` | Process-wide live-file budget: four fully reserved drops. One drop reserves `44046639` — its 42 MiB of file bytes plus the container header and manifest ceiling it is held in. Creating a fifth is refused until one lapses or is claimed. May only be lowered, and never below one drop's reservation. Bounds *resident payloads*, not the transient cost of a submission in flight, which is capped instead by admitting one upload at a time per drop. |
| `HANDOFF_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | `15000` | Whole-request deadline. Expiry answers the uniform `unavailable`, not a `408`. |
| `HANDOFF_FILE_SUBMIT_TIMEOUT_MS` | `600000` | Deadline for one *admitted file submission*, extending the above for that request only. A maximal drop is a ~56 MiB body: 600 s clears it at just under 1 Mbit/s sustained upstream, and **a slower link cannot complete a 42 MiB drop** — raise this, or lower `HANDOFF_MAX_FILE_TOTAL_BYTES`. May not exceed `HANDOFF_MAX_TTL_SECONDS`. |
| `HANDOFF_BODY_OVERRUN_ALLOWANCE_BYTES` | `1048576` | How far past a body ceiling the server keeps reading so the client still gets the uniform refusal instead of a reset. Additive, so it does not scale with the file ceiling. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_TRANSFER_ATTEMPTS` | `8` | How many transfer leases one drop grants without a commit. Each costs a full SHA-256 pass over the container, and a failed transfer restores the drop for free, so the pass is otherwise repeatable for the whole TTL. Spending the budget refuses further transfers (`transfer_failed` / `attempt_budget_spent`) and does **not** destroy the payload — the container is known good and the failures are the receiver's. Minimum 2, so one crash is always retriable. |
| `HANDOFF_FILE_CLAIM_LEASE_MS` | `60000` | How long one file-claim transfer lease may live. It bounds how long a crashed receiver can keep a submitted drop out of the next one's reach — and, because a leased drop still holds its live-file reservation, how long it can hold a quarter of the budget above without progress. A receiver may only *narrow* it, and it is clamped again to the handoff's own remaining time so an advertised deadline is always one the broker can honour. Raise it only for a genuinely slow spool disk; may not exceed `HANDOFF_MAX_TTL_SECONDS`, since a lease on a lapsed handoff could never be committed. |
| `HANDOFF_OUTBOUND_TTL_SECONDS` | `1800` | Default lifetime of an **outbound** drop — a secret Hermes hands *to* the user behind a 3-digit code. A separate dial from `HANDOFF_TTL_SECONDS` even where the two agree: an outbound link and its code sit in a conversation everyone in it can read, so this is the window in which someone else could open it. Minimum 1 second (a shorter drop can lapse before the message carrying its link renders, which the user cannot tell from a stolen secret). Must not exceed `HANDOFF_MAX_OUTBOUND_TTL_SECONDS`, and must not be shorter than `HANDOFF_OUTBOUND_ACK_WINDOW_MS` — see the startup refusal below. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_OUTBOUND_TTL_SECONDS` | `3600` | The longest outbound drop a caller may *ask* for. Its own ceiling rather than the inbound `HANDOFF_MAX_TTL_SECONDS`, so you can shorten outbound exposure without shortening the window a user gets to compose an inbound secret. **May only be lowered** from 3600, may not exceed `HANDOFF_MAX_TTL_SECONDS`, and may not be below `HANDOFF_OUTBOUND_TTL_SECONDS`. A request above it is refused with `invalid_request`, never clamped. |
| `HANDOFF_MAX_OUTBOUND_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` | `2048` | Largest outbound secret accepted. **May only be lowered**; a higher value is refused at startup, because this is what keeps a whole `create_outbound_drop` request inside the 4096-byte control-protocol request line. Outbound is for a short private value — outbound *file* sharing is out of scope. |
| `HANDOFF_OUTBOUND_ACK_WINDOW_MS` | `60000` | How long a reserved outbound drop waits for its claimant's acknowledgement before destroying the payload anyway. It bounds the one window in which the payload is both decryptable by a browser and still resident here, so it is what makes "destroyed after reveal" true for a browser that reveals and then vanishes. Clamped at claim time to the drop's own remaining life, and the value published to the page is clamped the same way. **May not exceed `HANDOFF_OUTBOUND_TTL_SECONDS`** — lowering the outbound TTL under 60 s without lowering this too is refused at startup, which under `restart: unless-stopped` is a crash loop until you fix it; the error message names both keys. |
| `HANDOFF_CONTROL_SOCKET` | `./run/control.sock` | `/run/handoff/control.sock` in the container. |
| `HANDOFF_SOCKET_DIR` | *(required by compose)* | Host directory bind-mounted at `/run/handoff`. Mode `0700`, owned by `1000:1000`, created before first start. |
| `HANDOFF_ENABLE_HSTS` | off | Enable only behind HTTPS. |

### Plugin

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `HERMES_DROP_CONTROL_SOCKET` env, or `plugins.entries.hermes-drop.control_socket` | `/run/handoff/control.sock` | An explicitly empty value disables the tools. Latched once per process. |
| Journal | `$HERMES_HOME/state/hermes-drop` | One JSON file per drop. Non-secret: routing, state, timestamps, purpose label. Never the capability or the payload. |

## Dependencies

| Package | Version | License | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`@hpke/core`](https://github.com/dajiaji/hpke-js) | 1.9.0 (exact) | MIT | RFC 9180 HPKE over WebCrypto only. Pulls `@hpke/common` 1.10.1, pinned via `overrides`. |
| [`esbuild`](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) | 0.28.1 (exact, dev only) | MIT | Bundles the page into one self-hosted file, so the CSP needs no `unsafe-inline`. |

No GPL/AGPL dependency. No database, Redis, analytics, CDN, third-party script or
persistent payload store. The plugin needs only PyYAML, which Hermes already has.
Tests use Node's built-in runner and pytest.

`test/hpke-vectors.test.js` reproduces published Base-mode vectors in both
directions, including RFC 9180 Appendix A.3.1. That is the substitute for an audit
of the library, not a replacement for one.

Internal identifiers say `handoff` throughout — the CLI, ids, environment
variables, container and service names. Hermes Drop is the product name; the
internal term was not worth a rename that would break every live deployment.
