# Host-side installer and preflight for the Hermes Secret Drop integration.
#
# Two independent jobs, deliberately kept in one script because an operator runs
# them minutes apart:
#
#   --preflight   Read-only validation of the host control-socket directory that
#                 compose.yml bind-mounts at /run/handoff (slice S2). Validates
#                 and reports; creates nothing, chmods nothing, restarts nothing.
#
#   install       Link this repo's plugin and Drop skill into the named profile
#   --copy        (or copy both) and enable the plugin in config.yaml
#   --uninstall   (slice S3). Idempotent. Restarts nothing.
#
# WHY IT REFUSES TO GUESS $HERMES_HOME. There is no fallback to ~/.hermes. A
# profile-scoped installer that defaults to the live default profile is one
# mistyped command — or one test run — away from installing into it. Every
# invocation names its target: `HERMES_HOME=~/.hermes bin/install-hermes-drop.sh
# install`. This also keeps the script honest about AGENTS.md profile rule 1
# (resolve the profile, never hardcode Path.home()/".hermes").
#
# WHAT IT NEVER DOES, at any point:
#   - restart, reload or otherwise touch a running gateway or broker
#   - `docker compose up` anything
#   - delete or edit a skill it did not install
#   - write plugins.entries.hermes-drop.allow_tool_override (Drop registers new
#     tool names and must never replace a built-in — hermes_cli/plugins.py:439-445)
# Those are operator steps behind the S11 gate. The script prints them so the
# operator can see the boundary rather than infer it.

  install       Symlink the plugin and stock /drop skill into \$HERMES_HOME

                removing '${LEGACY_PLUGIN_ID}' if present. Idempotent.
                A symlink keeps this repo the single source of truth.

  --copy        Same, but pin a versioned copy instead of a symlink (for hosts
                where \$HERMES_HOME must not depend on this checkout).

  --uninstall   Remove the managed plugin and /drop skill (link or copy) and
                remove '${PLUGIN_ID}' from plugins.enabled — that one entry and
                nothing else. No config.yaml backup is restored, so operator
                changes made since install are kept.

  --preflight   Validate the host control-socket directory named by
                HANDOFF_SOCKET_DIR: it must exist, be a directory, be mode 0700,
                and be owned by ${EXPECTED_UID}:${EXPECTED_GID} (the uid/gid
                compose.yml pins for the broker). Read-only.
