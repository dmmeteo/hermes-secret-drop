"""Hermes Secret Drop — origin-bound private input.

Source of truth is this repo (``secure-secret-handoff``); the installer
symlinks this directory into ``$HERMES_HOME/plugins/hermes-drop``. A live-only
plugin is exactly what produced the unversioned, untested
``hermes-drop-command`` that this replaces.

**Module-scope import discipline.** This file, and every module it reaches at
import time, must stay free of ``gateway.run``. Plugin discovery happens in
every CLI process, and the runner handle is a module global rebound during
``GatewayRunner.__init__`` — see ``drop/__init__.py`` for the full reasoning
and the test that enforces it.

Implemented so far: S3 (discovery, config gate, control client), S4
(``SourceRegistry`` and the origin hard gate), S5 (async messenger, sync
bridge, render matrix), S6 (journal, reconciler), S7 (``DropWaiter``,
``DropService``), S8 (entry points), S10 (deterministic ``/drop``), S12
(``/drop`` moved onto the stock skill-command seam; no core patch).

**``/drop`` is not registered here, and this file is where that is visible.**
The command is a stock Hermes *skill* command — ``integrations/drop-skill``,
scanned by ``agent/skill_commands.py`` and dispatched as an ordinary
authenticated agent turn. This plugin contributes the three origin-bound tools
that turn runs, the ``pre_gateway_dispatch`` capture callback, and the
``llm_request`` middleware. It registers no slash command at all: plugin
dispatch runs *before* skill dispatch in ``_handle_message``, so a plugin
``drop`` command would shadow the skill and drag the operation back onto a
pre-agent path with no authoritative session context of its own.

That is also why no Hermes core patch is required any more. The tools resolve
their origin on the agent path, where ``_set_session_env`` has already bound
this turn's identity — core's own behaviour, not a seam Drop had to add.

    It goes through ``_guarded`` unchanged, and the two things that pass through

    * ``vault.redact_tool_result`` finds no ``private_input`` field here and returns
      the receipt untouched — correctly, because an outbound result carries no value
      to redact. The invariant it enforces ("no plugin tool result carries a secret
      field") holds for this handler by construction rather than by substitution.
    * ``safe_errors.sanitize_tool_result`` still matters as much as ever: a refusal
      from this path can carry an adapter's own error string out of ``post_status``,
      and that is a leak into durable context regardless of which way the secret was
      travelling.

    What ``_guarded`` cannot do anything about is the *arguments*: they carry the
    plaintext, core persists a tool call before the handler runs, and no seam in this
    plugin sits earlier than that. ``generate`` is the mitigation, not a fix — see

    acts on ``skip`` / ``rewrite`` / ``allow`` (``gateway/run.py:13648-13668``);
    returning any of them would put Drop back in the business of deciding what a
    message means before auth has run. ``skip`` would make Drop an
    unauthenticated command surface — the hook fires before auth and pairing
    (``:13633`` vs ``:13670``) — and ``rewrite`` was S8's interim, which turned
    ``/drop`` into a sentence for the model because a plugin command handler had
    no bound session context to verify its origin against. Tier 2 (S9) binds one,
    so the handler initiates directly and this callback observes only. Nothing in
    the plugin can now produce text the user did not type.

    The reconcile trigger rides here because this is the only ``invoke_hook``
    site in ``gateway/run.py`` (``:13636``) and there is no gateway-ready hook
    (``hermes_cli/plugins.py:135-215``). It is latched to one run per process and
    shares that latch with the startup poller, so a busy gateway does not start a
    reconcile per message.
