"""Where the broker's control socket is, where claimed files land, and whether
Drop is configured at all.

Two questions with deliberately different answers about *when* they are resolved:
the socket path is latched for the life of the process (below), and the spool root
and TTL are resolved per call (:func:`spool_root`). The asymmetry is the point —
one of them decides whether a tool is in the prompt, and the other does not.

**The gate is process-constant on purpose** (plan §5.2). ``check_fn`` results
decide whether a tool's schema is in the prompt. A gate that probed the live
socket would flip to ``False`` every time ``docker compose up`` restarted the
broker and back to ``True`` a second later, adding and removing a tool
*mid-conversation* — which invalidates the per-conversation prompt cache prefix
that ``AGENTS.md`` treats as sacred. Core already TTL-caches ``check_fn`` for
30 s with a 60 s failure grace (``tools/registry.py:216-218``), so a
plugin-side cache would be dead weight on top of a gate that should not be
probing in the first place.

So the verdict answers a *configuration* question — "is a control socket path
configured?" — which is rung 3 of the Footprint Ladder, and it is latched at
first call.

**Honest note on how much that gate actually filters.** Because there is a
documented default path, the answer is ``True`` unless the operator explicitly
sets ``HERMES_DROP_CONTROL_SOCKET=""`` (or ``plugins.entries.hermes-drop.control_socket: ""``)
to opt out. This is a kill switch, not a discovery mechanism. Whether the broker
is *reachable* is a runtime condition and is reported as
``{"error": "broker_unavailable"}`` from the call site — never by removing the
tool from the schema.
