"""Async AF_UNIX client for the broker's control protocol.

Wire format and every constant below are the shared fixture
``contract/control-protocol.json``, which the Node server is held against by
``test/control-protocol.test.js`` and this client is held against by
``tests/test_control_client.py``. One fixture, two languages, no drift.

**Async by construction.** ``asyncio.open_unix_connection`` only — never
``socket.connect``, never a thread. Drop runs its sends and its multi-minute
waits on the gateway loop, so a blocking call here would stall every other
session on that loop (plan §7.1).

**Never raises.** Every failure comes back as a dict, because the callers are a
tool handler and a long-lived waiter task, and an exception escaping either one
is worse than an error string: a raising slash-command handler is swallowed at
``gateway/run.py:14701-14702`` and *falls through to skill resolution*,
resurrecting the ``/skill drop`` path this whole design exists to sever.

**Two ops carry a secret, in opposite directions, and neither is logged.**
``claim`` returns plaintext and hands the caller a base64 line; ``create_outbound_drop``
*sends* one. Nothing here logs, journals, or re-formats either — and the outbound
direction adds a rule the inbound one did not need: the response holds a link and a
code, and it is the caller's job to keep both out of everything except the chat
message they are for.

OUTBOUND_PAYLOAD_FORMAT = "structured"

#: A file transfer failed and **nothing was consumed**: the payload is untouched,
#: still one-shot, and still claimable by the next ``begin_file_claim``. Named for
#: the same reason as :data:`RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` and it matters more here, because a
#: transfer has many more ways to fail than a claim does — a busy lease, a lapsed
#: lease, a digest that did not match. A caller that recorded any of those as a spent
#: drop would manufacture the loss the two-phase protocol exists to prevent.
TRANSFER_FAILED = "transfer_failed"

#: contract/control-protocol.json -> file_claim.client_verdicts
#:
#: A verdict this side produces, never a line the broker sends — which is why it is
#: deliberately **not** in :data:`ERRORS`. It means the commit was written and no
#: answer was read: the connection closed, or this client stopped waiting. The commit
#: is one-shot, non-idempotent and not requeryable, so the payload may have been
#: retired with only the answer lost.
#:
#: There is exactly one safe response, and it is none of the obvious ones: publish
#: nothing (the verification verdict never arrived), retry nothing (a retry answered
#: ``unavailable`` cannot be told apart from a drop that was already claimed, so it
#: adds ambiguity rather than resolving it), and record nothing as spent (it may not
#: be). Surface the drop id for an operator and let the TTL settle it.
TRANSFER_INDETERMINATE = "transfer_indeterminate"

#: The broker refused *before consuming* because the answer would not fit in the
#: ``max_response_bytes`` this client advertised. Named because it is the one
#: broker error a caller must not treat like ``unavailable``: the payload is
#: untouched and still claimable, so marking the drop spent would manufacture the
#: loss the refusal just prevented.
RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE = "response_too_large"

#: Local-only error kinds. These are *transport* verdicts the client itself
#: produces; the broker never sends them. Kept distinct from ERRORS so a caller
#: can tell "the broker answered" from "the broker did not".
BROKER_UNAVAILABLE = "broker_unavailable"

DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 10.0

#: contract/control-protocol.json -> transport.max_response_bytes
#:
#: A response line is bounded too, and this constant is the bound that is
#: **actually applied** — it is passed to ``open_unix_connection`` as the
#: ``StreamReader`` limit, so ``readline`` refuses to buffer past it — *and* the
#: bound this client declares on every ``claim``, so the broker sizes its answer
#: against it before consuming anything. One number doing both jobs is the point:
#: a limit the reader enforces but never states is a limit the broker can only
#: discover by destroying a payload.
#:
#: It has to be set deliberately, because asyncio's default is 65536 and a
#: ``claim`` response is base64 of the broker's ``maxPlaintextBytes``
#: (65536, ``src/config.js:11``) — 87,384 bytes, comfortably past that default.
#: Left at the default, any plaintext over roughly 49 KB made ``readline`` raise
#: ``ValueError`` *after* ``broker.claim`` had already detached and retired the
#: payload: the secret was destroyed and the caller was told ``internal_error``
#: (review H2). 1 MiB is generous headroom over the base64 ceiling and still
#: refuses to buffer an unbounded stream from a compromised socket.
#:
#: Pinned from both sides by ``tests/test_control_client.py``: a real
#: ``maxPlaintextBytes``-sized claim must round-trip byte for byte, a line past
#: *this* limit must still come back as a dict, and a claim the broker sizes past
#: it must come back as ``response_too_large`` with the payload still there.
MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES = 1024 * 1024

#: contract/control-protocol.json -> transport.min_response_bytes
#:
#: The floor the broker puts under an advertised ceiling. Nothing here goes
#: anywhere near it — this client advertises a megabyte — but it is the number
#: that makes the refusal *readable*: every non-payload line, ``response_too_large``
#: included, fits inside it, so no conforming client is ever answered with a
#: refusal it cannot buffer. Pinned against the fixture by the tests.
MIN_RESPONSE_BYTES = 1024

#: Every size in this module is of the whole line as written to the socket,
#: **newline included** (contract ``transport.size_convention``). That is not a
#: detail: ``StreamReader`` applies its limit to the line plus its separator, so a
#: broker that counted the newline out would size a claim as fitting when the
#: reader would refuse it by one byte. ``src/control-server.js``'s
#: ``claimResponseBytes`` counts it in, and a test reads a line of exactly the
#: limit to prove the two conventions are the same one.

#: Room for the JSON around the payload: ``{"ok":true,"plaintext_b64":"…"}`` and a
#: newline, with generous slack for any field the protocol grows.
_CLAIM_ENVELOPE_SLACK_BYTES = 4096

#: The largest broker ``maxPlaintextBytes`` whose base64 claim response still fits
#: inside :data:`MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` — the read limit is a constant, so this is the
#: bound it implies (review N2). base64 is ×4/3, with slack for the JSON envelope,
#: so it is deliberately a little under what the broker's own exact arithmetic
#: (``claimPayloadBudget``, ``src/control-server.js``) will allow.
#:
#: Above this a claim is *refused* rather than delivered: the broker sizes the
#: answer against the advertised ceiling and answers ``response_too_large`` with
#: the record untouched. That is no longer a destroyed secret — it used to be,
#: before the ceiling was on the wire — but it is still an undeliverable one, and
#: the user has already typed it into the form by then. So the plugin's job is
#: unchanged: notice at *create* time, while a drop is still only a drop.
#: ``compose.yml`` pins 65536, an order of magnitude clear of it.
