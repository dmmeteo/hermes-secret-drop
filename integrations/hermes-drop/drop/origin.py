"""Resolve the origin, or refuse. There is no third outcome.

There is no branch anywhere in this module where a missing value becomes a
default, a home channel, or a configured platform. That is the incident restated
as code: ``/drop`` in Telegram put its link in a Discord channel because the only
generic send available fell back to ``config.get_home_channel(platform)`` when no
chat id was given (``tools/send_message_tool.py:446-465``).

Resolution order (plan §4), then a **mandatory** verification:

1. ``sources.turn_source()`` — the same-turn ContextVar.
2. ``REGISTRY.by_routing_tuple(routing_tuple_from_context())`` — the wake-turn
   path, available even on internal turns where the capture hook never fires
   (``gateway/run.py:13633``).
3. ``REGISTRY.by_session_key(HERMES_SESSION_KEY)`` — for a lane that drifted.
4. Nothing → ``no_origin``.

Whatever is found must then agree with the bound contextvars on
``(platform, profile, chat_id, thread_id)``, or it is refused. This is *not*
revision 1's deleted cross-turn origin stamp, which compared two values derived
from the same ``SessionSource`` and was unreachable by construction. It is
reachable two ways, both tested: an inherited foreign ``_TURN_SOURCE`` on an
internal turn, and a stale store entry after ``_apply_topic_recovery`` rewrote the
lane (``gateway/platforms/base.py:3306-3325``, called ``:5552``).

**Known bounded limitation, stated rather than hidden.** On an internal wake turn
the routing-tuple lookup is the real path; if the lane was rewritten between
initiation and wake, tier 2 misses, tier 3's entry disagrees, and this refuses.
The consequence is that the model cannot open a *new* drop during a continuation
turn and says so; the user types ``/drop``. Claiming is unaffected — it needs no
adapter and no send, only the routing tuple.
