"""The structured outbound payload, from this side of the socket.

The producer half of ``src/outbound-payload.js``. The broker validates
independently and is the authority — a payload this module builds and the broker
refuses is a defect *here*, and the operator hears about it — so what this module
is for is not enforcement but the two things enforcement cannot do:

1. **Refuse before a drop exists.** The broker's refusal is already atomic (no
   drop, no link, no code), but by then a round trip has been spent and the
   refusal has to be turned back into something a model can act on. Checking the
   same bounds here means the *usual* mistake — a label with a newline in it, a
   value over the ceiling, a ninth field — is answered with the rule it broke and
   the field it broke it on, without touching the broker at all.

2. **Normalise what is safe to normalise, and nothing else.** A label and a title
   are display strings: leading and trailing whitespace is stripped and internal
   runs are collapsed to single spaces, because a model that emitted ``"API  key"``
   meant ``"API key"`` and refusing that is pedantry with no safety behind it.

   A **value is never modified**. Not trimmed, not collapsed, not normalised. A
   password with a trailing space is a different password, and silently repairing
   it would deliver a credential that does not authenticate and give nobody a way
   to find out why. So a padded value is *refused* and the model is told which
   field, which is the one outcome that leads to the right value being sent.

Two implementations of one schema is a drift risk, and it is taken deliberately
rather than by omission: the alternative is this side sending an unvalidated blob
and learning the bounds only from the broker, which puts the error message a round
trip and a language away from the model that has to act on it. The bounds
themselves live in ``contract/control-protocol.json`` →  ``outbound_payload``, the
same shared fixture the control protocol uses, and ``tests/test_outbound_payload.py``
pins every constant below against it *and* runs the real broker over the real
socket to prove the two agree on live payloads rather than only on numbers.

**Nothing here logs.** Every value that passes through this module is a secret,
and every refusal names a rule and a field index — never a label, never a value.
