"""What runs when the fast path did not.

The waiter (S7) is the latency path. This is the mechanism that has to be right
when there is no waiter: after a gateway restart, after a wake the busy handler
dropped, after a crash mid-turn. It reads the journal — the only durable thing
Drop has — and drives every entry it finds to the state the world is actually in.

**Why it needs its own trigger.** ``pre_gateway_dispatch`` is the only
``invoke_hook`` site in ``gateway/run.py`` (``:13636``), it fires only for
non-internal events (``:13633``), and no gateway-ready hook exists (``VALID_HOOKS``,
``hermes_cli/plugins.py:135-215``). After a restart with no user message, nothing
would ever run, and the status message would keep advertising a link the
in-memory broker destroyed at startup (``src/broker.js:95-102``). So there are
two triggers — a bounded startup daemon thread and the dispatch hook — behind one
test-and-set latch, which is what makes "exactly once per process" hold no matter
which fires first.

**Why the startup thread writes nothing until it finds a runner.** Plugin
discovery happens in every CLI process. ``hermes plugins list`` must not create
``$HERMES_HOME/state/hermes-drop``, so the journal is never even constructed
until a live ``GatewayRunner`` and its loop exist. Pinned by
``test_reconciler.py::test_a_bounded_poll_that_never_finds_a_runner_exits_quietly``.

**How liveness is decided.** The control protocol has three ops and one uniform
``unavailable`` body, so a destroyed record and a live pending one answer alike —
except in *timing*, which the contract documents as deliberate: ``await`` "blocks
only for a live pending handoff and therefore leaks liveness to its local caller
by construction" (``contract/control-protocol.json``; ``src/broker.js:315-341``).
So the probe is a bounded ``await`` whose *elapsed time* is the verdict. The
misjudgement direction is safe by construction: the broker cannot answer before
its own timer, so an early answer proves the record was not live — while a late
answer to a gone record only mislabels it ``live``, and re-arming a waiter on a
gone record resolves it to ``expired`` a moment later anyway.

**Origin resolution here is not ``resolve_origin``.** That function verifies
against bound session contextvars, which is exactly right inside a turn and
meaningless in a background pass where none are bound. Here the *journal entry's*
routing tuple is the authority, and the source registry is consulted only to find
the live ``SessionSource`` object for that lane — never for drop identity, which
is the journal id and nothing else.

    A pass that drives every entry it finds leaves the latch consumed, and that
    is the property the latch exists for: one reconcile per gateway, not one per
    message. But a pass over lanes the source registry does not know is not that
    pass. It read the journal, found entries it could not attach to a live
    conversation, probed nothing and wrote nothing. ``origin_for_entry`` says of
    exactly this case that ``None`` means "retry at the next trigger", never
    "give up" — and until this existed there was no next trigger, because the one
    attempt the process had was spent on the pass that did nothing.

    After a restart that is the *normal* first pass: the registry is empty until
    a conversation speaks, so every waiting drop was abandoned in ``waiting``
    with its status message still advertising a link the restarted broker had
    already destroyed (``src/broker.js:95-102``) — for the life of the process.

    So the latch goes back, but not unconditionally. The comment on
    ``MAX_FAILED_PASSES`` rules that out for a good reason: an unconditional
    release turns a permanently unresolvable lane into a reconcile pass on
    *every* inbound message, each one re-probing every live drop over the control
    socket. The lanes are recorded instead, and ``trigger_from_event`` refuses to
    spend the latch again until one of them resolves — the same sentence
    ``origin_for_entry`` already made the promise in.

    **Cost.** The gate is not free and is not O(1): every dispatch that arrives
    while a deferral is outstanding runs one registry peek plus one adapter
    resolution *per deferred lane*, i.e. O(N) for N distinct lanes holding
    waiting drops. Both are in-process dictionary work with no I/O, no probe and
    no journal read, and N is bounded by the number of conversations with a live
    drop — but "one dict lookup per message" would be wrong, and the difference
    matters on a gateway with many outstanding drops. ``MAX_DEFERRED_PASSES``
