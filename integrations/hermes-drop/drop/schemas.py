"""Model-facing tool schemas.

**There is no destination field, and there never will be one.** Not
``platform``, not ``chat_id``, not ``channel``, ``channel_id``, ``thread_id``,
``user_id``, ``target`` or ``home``, at any depth. That absence *is* the safety
argument: the incident this design exists to prevent was a ``/drop`` typed in
Telegram whose link landed in a Discord channel, and the mechanism was a
generic send whose one-token ``target`` defaulted to the configured home
channel (``tools/send_message_tool.py:446-465``). A model that cannot express a
destination cannot pick the wrong one.

``tests/test_schemas.py`` walks every schema recursively and fails on any of
those names appearing anywhere — key or value.

There are three schemas: the two inbound ones (ask for a secret, retrieve it) and
``SEND_PRIVATE_OUTPUT``, which runs the other way. The no-destination rule is not
weaker on the outbound one — it is *stronger*, because a misrouted inbound drop asks
a stranger for a password and a misrouted outbound one hands them one.

``minutes`` is bounded 1..60, inside the broker's ``maxTtlSeconds: 3600``
(``src/config.js:10``, not overridden in ``compose.yml``).

#: because a model that cannot express one cannot pick the wrong one.

#: * **No free-text body.** The payload is a list of labelled fields, so the page can

#:   would render one blob.
#: * **No ``code`` or ``url`` in the result.** The tool returns labels, a deadline
#:   and a drop id. The link and the code go to the conversation; putting them in a
#:   tool result would copy them into the model's context and from there into durable
