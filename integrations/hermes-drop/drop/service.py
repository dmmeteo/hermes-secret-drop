"""The one async domain workflow. Both entry points call *this*, not each other.

``/drop`` and ``request_private_input`` differ only in how they reach here: the
command is already on the gateway loop, the tool crosses once through
``SyncBridge`` for the whole operation (``drop/bridge.py``). Neither re-implements
any of the steps below, which is what makes "the command and the tool are the
same operation" a property rather than an intention.

**create** — mint, post, journal, arm. In that order, and the order is the
argument:

1. *Mint* first, because the notice cannot be rendered without the URL, and the
   broker validates ``notice_platform`` before minting anything
   (``src/control-server.js``), so an unsupported platform costs no handoff.
2. *Post* second. If the post fails the drop is **aborted**: no journal entry, no
   waiter, ``{"error": "post_failed"}``. A live capability whose link was never
   delivered is pure risk (§7.2). The minted handoff is left to lapse at its own
   TTL — the control protocol has no destroy op, and inventing one to cover a
   failed send would be a bigger change than the risk it removes.
3. *Journal* third: from here the drop is recoverable without any live task.
4. *Arm* last, because the waiter is the latency path and everything before it
   already made the outcome durable.

**claim** — the only path by which plaintext enters the conversation, and it
enters as a *tool result*, where ``transform_tool_result`` operates on the string
before it re-enters context (``model_tools.py:1380-1412``); wake text has no
equivalent hook. Durable ``state.db`` exposure is unchanged and still accepted —
this buys a future sanitization seam, not a guarantee (§3.2).

Its order is an argument too, and a shorter one: **ask, receive, then record.**
The broker destroys its copy as it answers, so everything before the answer may
fail freely and everything after it holds the only copy there is. That splits the
failures in two. Before: a refusal, and the drop is untouched — including
``response_too_large``, which the broker returns *without consuming* when the
answer would overrun the reader this client advertised (``max_response_bytes``,
``contract/control-protocol.json``). After: bookkeeping, which is no longer
allowed to fail the claim, because a ``claimed_at`` write that raised used to turn
a delivered secret into ``internal_error`` and nothing else.

Authorisation is the journal's, not this module's: the routing tuple, never
``session_key`` (§8.5). And it never consults ``announced_at`` — a claim must
work with no wake having landed at all.

**send_outbound** — the other direction (docs/OUTBOUND_SECRET_DROP_MVP.md): Hermes
already holds a secret and the *user* is the one who has to receive it. Build,
mint, post — and then nothing, which is the part worth reading the method's own
docstring for: it journals nothing and arms nothing, deliberately, because there is
no submission to wait for and no later claim to authorise.

        destroys the payload as it answers. So the capability is read off the
        ``create`` response (``supports_lossless_claim``) rather than assumed from
        this plugin's own version — the two are installed and upgraded separately.

        *Can this client read back everything the broker will accept?* The control
        client's response limit is a constant and base64 is ×4/3, so a broker
        configured past ``MAX_CLAIMABLE_PLAINTEXT_BYTES`` can accept a payload
        whose claim response overruns the reader (review N2, the survivor of

        and that absence is deliberate rather than unfinished —

        * there is nothing to *wait* for. An inbound drop is armed because a
          submission is an event the model has to be told about; an outbound reveal
          is deliberately not attributable to a conversation (the broker holds
          ciphertext it cannot read and a code verifier it cannot reverse), so there
          is no event to announce and no second message to edit into place;
        * there is nothing to *claim*. The payload goes to the browser, never back
          through this socket, so no durable record is needed to authorise a later
          retrieval — and a journal entry that recorded one would be a row implying a
          recovery path that does not exist;
        * so the whole lifecycle is one post, and a durable record of it would buy an
          audit line at the cost of a failure mode (a journal write that raises after
          a link is live) with nothing to recover. The chat message *is* the record,
          and it carries ``drop:<id>`` for exactly that reason.

        **Failure ordering.** The payload is validated here, before the broker is
        touched, so the ordinary mistake costs no round trip and mints nothing. A
        broker refusal mints nothing by construction. A failed *post* is the one
        case with a cost: the drop is minted, its link and code were never
        delivered, and there is no destroy op — so it lapses at its TTL, unseen and
        unusable, which is the same argument §7.2 makes for the inbound direction.
        It is worse here in one respect and it is worth saying plainly: what lapses
        is a *secret Hermes was holding*, not an empty form. Thirty minutes of a
        ciphertext nobody has the link to is the accepted cost of not inventing a
        destroy op for this slice.

        **What comes back.** A receipt with the labels and no values, no code and no
        URL. The model needs to know what it sent and that it arrived; it does not
        need the credential back, and the code and the link belong to the
        conversation rather than to the model's context.

        already successfully delivered is a worse outcome than an unmarked entry
        in every case, so the ordering stands and the failure is contained here.

        The unmarked entry is not silently tolerated either: it is an ``ERROR``
        line for the operator, and the caller says so in its result. What it
        cannot cause is a second delivery — ``authorize_claim`` will let the retry
        through, and the broker's payload-free receipt refuses it. That is the
        same one-shot guarantee as always, enforced where it has always been
        enforced, which is why this needs no distributed transaction.
