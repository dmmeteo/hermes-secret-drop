"""Capture and store the REAL ``SessionSource`` for a turn.

One mechanism, one writer, two lookup indices.

**Why not rebuild the source from the bound contextvars?** Because the rebuild is
provably lossy in exactly the fields that decide routing. ``_set_session_env``
propagates platform / chat_id / chat_type / chat_name / thread_id / user_id /
user_name / session_key / message_id / profile and nothing else
(``gateway/run.py:20255-20269``). It drops ``scope_id`` — so
``_thread_metadata_for_source`` cannot derive ``slack_team_id``
(``gateway/platforms/base.py:78-83``) — drops
``parent_chat_id``/``chat_id_alt``/``user_id_alt``, and cannot carry
``delivered_via_upstream_relay``, which is deliberately excluded from
``to_dict`` (``gateway/session.py:194-206``) and is precisely what
the gateway's adapter resolution keys relay delivery off (``gateway/authz_mixin.py``).
A hand-built source also has no ``_transport_adapter_ref``, so
``_registered_transport_adapter`` returns ``None`` and per-credential transport
provenance is discarded (``:128-149``).

**Why no core change is needed.** ``invoke_hook`` calls ``ret = cb(**kwargs)``
directly and synchronously (``hermes_cli/plugins.py:1933`` via
``hermes_cli/lifecycle.py:11-22``) inside the ``_handle_message`` task, so a
``ContextVar.set()`` here mutates *that* context and is visible for the rest of
the turn — including ``_run_in_executor_with_context``, which snapshots with
``copy_context()`` and runs ``ctx.run`` on the worker
(``gateway/run.py:20276-20285``).

**Why a ContextVar is not enough on its own.** ``copy_context()`` is a copy in
one direction. A ``.set()`` inside the snapshot never escapes back to the
caller, and a later turn gets its own context, so a context-local cannot carry a
source across turns. The registry is the cross-turn path; the ContextVar is only
the same-turn fast path. Both directions are pinned in ``tests/test_sources.py``.

**Why the ContextVar is not trusted.** ``asyncio.create_task`` snapshots the
current context, so a task spawned while a concurrent turn had already set
``_TURN_SOURCE`` inherits that foreign source. Non-internal events overwrite it
within a few statements; **internal** events never run this callback at all
(``gateway/run.py:13633``), so an inherited value can survive a whole wake turn.
``origin.resolve_origin`` therefore verifies whatever it finds against the bound
contextvars and refuses on disagreement.

**Not keyed by ``message_id``.** It is empty on a Discord native slash —
``_build_slash_event`` never sets it
(``plugins/platforms/discord/adapter.py:5814-5856``) — so a ``message_id``-bearing
key is non-unique by construction. That non-uniqueness is the defect that killed
revision 1's origin stamp.

Nothing stored here is secret: a live ``SessionSource``, a weakref to the runner,
a session key, and a timestamp.

    The two indices are genuinely independent, not one index plus an alias. That
    matters for the tier-3 lookup: a ``/new``, a compression rotation, or a
    topic-recovery rewrite can invalidate the routing lane while the session key
    still names the same conversation, so the session-key index has to survive
    the routing entry going away. Both indices are still LRU- and TTL-bounded, so
    neither can grow without limit or serve an arbitrarily old source.

    **Thread-safe by one lock, and it has to be.** This store is read from a
    different thread than it is written from, in ordinary steady state: ``capture``
    and ``DropWaiter._republish`` run on the gateway loop, while ``resolve_origin``
    runs on a ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` worker for every model tool call
    (``gateway/run.py:18604`` -> ``:20276-20285``). Nothing about that is a corner
    case, and ``OrderedDict`` is not safe across it: ``_purge`` iterates
    ``index.items()`` while a concurrent ``_get`` calls ``move_to_end``, which
    bumps the dict version and so counts as a mutation during iteration
    (``RuntimeError``), and at the LRU cap a reader can ``move_to_end`` a key
    another thread just evicted (``KeyError``). Review M1 measured 70 faults in
    four seconds at 40 live lanes with no eviction and no expiry.

    An ``RLock`` rather than a ``Lock``, because the lock-holding methods nest:
    ``put`` calls ``_purge`` and ``_trim``, and ``_get`` calls ``_drop``. A
    non-reentrant lock would deadlock the gateway loop on the first capture.

    The lock is held for the whole of every public method, including the read
    methods and ``keys`` / ``__len__``, because a reader mutates recency and is
    therefore a writer. Contention is not a concern: every critical section is a
    dict operation over a store bounded at ``maxlen``, with no I/O and no await
    inside it.
