"""The three tool handlers. Thin on purpose: every gate, then ``DropService``.

Order of operations, and why it is this order:

1. **Validate arguments.** ``minutes`` outside 1..60 is refused, not clamped.
   The schema bounds it, but a schema is advisory to a model; refusing means the
   broker's own ``maxTtlSeconds`` check is never the first line of defence, and
   the user never silently gets a different lifetime than the conversation agreed.
2. **Resolve and verify the origin** (``origin.resolve_origin``). Fail closed on
   ``no_origin`` / ``origin_mismatch`` / ``origin_unverified`` /
   ``gateway_unavailable`` / ``no_adapter``.
3. **Gate on the platform** (``render.is_supported``) — *before* anything is
   minted. An unsupported platform is refused by name, never degraded to a plain
   notice and never redirected to a platform that is supported.
4. **Cross to the gateway loop once**, through ``SyncBridge``, for the *whole*
   operation — and only from here. A model tool handler runs on a
   ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` worker (``gateway/run.py:18604`` → ``:20276-20285``);
   ``DropService`` is async end to end and must run on the loop the adapters and
   the waiter live on.

The runner for the bridge is taken from the **resolved origin**, not resolved a
second time: the origin already holds the runner it verified the adapter against,
and looking it up again could pick up a different one mid-shutdown.

Nothing here formats a link, a capability or a payload. ``request_private_input``
returns a non-secret receipt; ``claim_private_input`` returns the plaintext as a
tool result, which is the one and only path by which it reaches the model (§3.2);
``send_private_output`` runs the other way — its *arguments* carry the secret and its
result carries none of it, no value, no code and no URL.

**Every result leaves through ``safe_errors.sanitize_tool_result``.** A refusal
here is a *tool result*, so it enters the model's context and from there durable
``state.db`` — and ``post_status``'s ``detail`` is ``str(exc)`` or an adapter's own
error string, which can carry a socket path or internals nothing in this repo
governs (review L1). The command path has had a fixed refusal vocabulary since
S10; this is the same table applied at the other entry point. Success results pass
through untouched, ``private_input`` included.

    higher stakes, no shortcuts.

    **The arguments carry the secret, and this is the seam where that is true.** It
    is not avoidable in general — Hermes cannot hand over a value it was not given —
    and it is why the ``generate`` field exists: for a value that is being *created*
    rather than relayed, the request says "make me a 24-character password" and the
    plaintext never enters a tool argument, a model turn or a durable transcript at
    all. See the ``send_outbound`` docstring in ``drop/service.py`` and the risk this
