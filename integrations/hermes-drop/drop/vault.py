"""Keep the claimed plaintext out of durable Hermes state.

``claim_private_input`` is the one path by which a secret enters a model turn,
and it enters as a tool result. The core lifecycle for a tool result, verified
read-only against the installed checkout at ``ebd91f8d56``, is:

1. ``model_tools.execute_tool`` dispatches the handler, emits ``post_tool_call``,
   then offers the **result string** to ``transform_tool_result``
   (``model_tools.py:1388-1412``) and returns whatever survives.
2. ``agent/tool_executor.py:1894-1901`` wraps that same string with
   ``make_tool_result_message``, appends it to ``messages`` and immediately
   flushes: ``_flush_session_db_after_tool_progress`` →
   ``_flush_messages_to_session_db`` → ``SessionDB.append_message``. So
   ``state.db``, the ``messages_fts*`` triggers and the JSON session log are all
   written **before** the API call that shows the model anything.
3. The request is built by ``build_api_kwargs`` — which is also where every
   provider-native message translation happens — and ``api_kwargs`` is then
   passed through ``apply_llm_request_middleware``
   (``agent/conversation_loop.py:2096-2112``); that call's returned payload *is*
   what reaches the provider.

There is therefore exactly one string at step 1, and it is simultaneously the
durable row and the wire. ``transform_tool_result`` cannot separate them —
redacting there redacts the model turn too. Nor is there a seam after step 2:
``pre_api_request``/``post_api_request`` discard their return values
(``conversation_loop.py:2146``), ``run_agent.py:1931+`` records the invariant
"No code path edits a persisted message's content/role in place expecting a
re-write", and ``SessionDB`` offers no per-row redaction — only a whole-session
``replace_messages``.

The two copies first diverge at step 3, so that is where the split is made:

* **Durable** — the plugin substitutes a placeholder *before* the dict becomes a
  tool-result string (``__init__.py::_guarded``). Nothing downstream of the
  plugin ever holds the plaintext, and that property depends on no core hook.
  Deliberately not ``transform_tool_result``: it is ``has_hook``-gated and
  wrapped in a bare ``except`` that logs at debug and carries on
  (``model_tools.py:1411``), so a hook that fails *open* cannot be what stands
  between a password and ``state.db``.
* **Wire** — ``llm_request`` middleware puts the plaintext back, into the deep
  copy ``apply_llm_request_middleware`` made (``middleware.py:94-95``), so the
  persisted dicts are never touched. ``ctx.register_middleware`` is a supported
  plugin API (``hermes_cli/plugins.py:1196``) and ``"llm_request"`` is in
  ``VALID_MIDDLEWARE`` (``hermes_cli/middleware.py:29-34``).

**The substitution walks the payload structurally**, because by step 3 the
tool result no longer has one shape. ``build_api_kwargs`` has already translated
it into whatever the active ``api_mode`` speaks, and the placeholder lands in a
different key in each (all verified in the adapters, and pinned by tests that
build the shapes with the real converters rather than by hand):

===================== ======================================================
``api_mode``          where the tool result ends up
===================== ======================================================
``chat_completions``  ``messages[].content`` — ``str``, or text parts
``anthropic_messages`` ``messages[].content[]`` → ``{"type": "tool_result",
                      "content": <str>}`` — note ``content``, not ``text``
                      (``agent/anthropic_adapter.py:2276-2281``)
``codex_responses``   ``input[]`` → ``{"type": "function_call_output",
                      "output": <str>}`` — no ``content`` key at all
                      (``agent/codex_responses_adapter.py:613-617``)
``bedrock_converse``  ``messages[].content[]`` → ``{"toolResult":
                      {"content": [{"text": <str>}]}}`` — two levels deeper
                      (``agent/bedrock_adapter.py:645-651``)
===================== ======================================================

Enumerating those four by key would be wrong the day a fifth transport lands, so
the walk descends every mapping, sequence and string in the payload and
substitutes wherever a live placeholder appears. A placeholder is a 128-bit
random token that exists nowhere but a transcript this vault minted, so "found
it" and "it belongs here" are the same statement. Nothing is rebuilt unless a
substitution actually happened, and the whole walk is skipped when the vault is
empty — which is every request in every session that never claimed.

**Both directions fail closed.** A middleware callback that raises is isolated
and logged by ``PluginManager.invoke_middleware``, leaving the placeholder on
the wire; anything this module refuses to stash raises :class:`VaultError`
through ``_guarded``'s catch-all into ``internal_error``. The failure mode is a
model that cannot read the secret, never a secret in ``state.db``.

**The placeholder is not a bearer capability.** It outlives the plaintext in the
durable transcript, so an entry is bound to the ``session_id`` that claimed it
(the same ``agent.session_id`` reaches both seams — ``tool_executor.py:1678``
and ``conversation_loop.py:2103``) and is resolved for that session only. A
claim that arrives with **no** session id is refused rather than stashed under
``""``, which would make one placeholder resolvable from any other session that
also lacked one.

**What this does not confine.** The model receives the real plaintext, so
anything it then does with it — echoing it into a reply, passing it as an
argument to another tool — is persisted like any other model output. That
exposure is unchanged and still accepted (§3.2); the model is a trusted
principal. Nor does it confine anything that reads the request *after*
middleware; see ``SECURITY.md``.
