"""The real gateway dispatch seam, driven from this repo.

Slice S10's whole claim is about a *core* control path: with Tier 2 applied
(Hermes branch ``drop/plugin-command-origin``, commits ``2f487f61a8`` and
``6fd0876edd``), ``/drop`` is dispatched by
``GatewayRunner._handle_message`` → the plugin branch at ``gateway/run.py:14690``
→ ``_check_slash_access(source, plugin_command)`` at ``:14707`` →
``_set_session_env_from_source(source, _quick_key)`` at ``:14721`` →
``await plugin_handler(user_args)`` at ``:14726-14728``. Every property S10 has
to prove — no model turn, one service call, the origin verified against a
*bound* context, denial before the handler, no fall-through to
``/skill drop`` — is a property of that block.

So the tests do not transcribe it. They call the real
``GatewayRunner._handle_message`` on a bare runner built the way the Hermes
checkout's own S9 tests build one
(``tests/gateway/test_plugin_command_context.py::_make_runner``), with three
substitutions and no others:

* ``adapters`` are :class:`_stubs.StubAdapter`s — real ``build_source``
  provenance, recording send/edit, no network. The gateway resolves them through
  its real adapter-resolution seam (``_delivery_adapter_for`` on Hermes 0.21.5+,
  ``_adapter_for_source`` before).
* ``_handle_message_with_agent`` is an ``AsyncMock``. It is the *single* place
  ``_handle_message`` enters the agent (``gateway/run.py:14940``), so "the model
  was never asked" is exactly "this mock was never awaited".
* ``gateway.run._gateway_runner_ref`` is pointed at the runner, which is how
  production hands the plugin its runner (``drop/origin.py::_resolve_runner``).

``DropService`` is injected by monkeypatching the class the handler
instantiates, never by passing kwargs: core calls ``plugin_handler(user_args)``
positionally with one string (``:14726``), so a test that passed injection
kwargs would be testing a signature production cannot use.
