"""Shared fixtures for the hermes-drop plugin tests.

These tests live in *this* repo, not in the hermes-agent checkout, so none of
that checkout's ``tests/conftest.py`` applies. Every isolation invariant it
provides has to be re-established here, deliberately and visibly:

1. **Hermetic ``HERMES_HOME``.** Set to a throwaway tempdir *before any hermes
   module is imported*, for the same reason hermes' own conftest does it at
   import time rather than in a fixture: ``hermes_cli.main`` calls
   ``setup_logging()`` at module scope, which resolves ``get_hermes_home()``
   and attaches rotating file handlers. Binding it in a fixture would be too
   late — the handler would already hold an absolute path into the operator's
   real ``~/.hermes/logs``. **No test in this directory may write under
   ``~/.hermes``.** ``test_isolation.py`` asserts that.

2. **No inherited session identity.** ``HERMES_SESSION_*`` is stripped so the
   operator's live gateway session cannot satisfy an origin lookup that should
   have refused.

3. **Repo-root import path.** The hermes checkout is put on ``sys.path`` so
   ``gateway.*`` / ``hermes_cli.*`` import. ``scripts/run_tests.sh`` already
   runs each file with ``cwd`` at the checkout root, so this is belt and
   braces for anyone running ``pytest`` on a single file directly.

4. **Plugin package loaded the way core loads it.** ``load_plugin_package()``
   mirrors ``PluginManager._load_directory_module``
   (``hermes_cli/plugins.py:1865-1887``) exactly: a namespace parent named
   ``hermes_plugins``, a spec built with ``submodule_search_locations``, and
   the module registered as ``hermes_plugins.hermes_drop``. Tests therefore
   exercise the same import shape production does — including the relative
   imports inside the package — rather than a ``sys.path`` shortcut that would
   hide an import bug until install time.
