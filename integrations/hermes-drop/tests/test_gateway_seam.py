"""S12 — ``/drop`` is a **stock** skill command, and this is that seam.

Every test here drives the real ``GatewayRunner._handle_message`` with the
plugin installed through the real ``PluginManager`` and the Drop skill visible
to the real ``scan_skill_commands``. Nothing transcribes a core code block: the
claim is a claim about core's own control flow, unpatched.

``_handle_message`` → ``invoke_hook("pre_gateway_dispatch")`` (capture only)
→ auth → quick commands → plugin commands (**none**, we register none)
→ ``resolve_skill_command_key("drop")`` → ``build_skill_invocation_message``
→ ``event.text`` replaced → falls through → ``_handle_message_with_agent``.

What that buys, and what it costs, stated plainly:

* **Buys.** No core patch. The origin the tools resolve is bound by core's own
  ``_set_session_env`` on the agent path, which has always been there — Drop no
  longer needs a session-context binding around plugin dispatch, and the plugin
  no longer needs a slash command at all. It also buys the prompt: a non-empty
  ``/drop <prompt>`` is a sentence the *user typed*, carried verbatim into the
  turn, rather than a duration grammar the user has to learn.
* **Costs.** A skill command is not covered by ``_check_slash_access`` — that
  gate runs for registry-known commands, quick commands and *plugin* commands
  only. ``allow_admin_from`` / ``user_allowed_commands`` therefore no longer
  restrict ``/drop``. This is pinned below as a fact rather than papered over.
  It is not a new capability: the same authorized user could always reach
  ``request_private_input`` by asking for it in plain language, so the
  enforceable controls are authorization (which still gates the whole message)
  and the per-platform skill/toolset switches — not the slash policy.

Nothing about the safety envelope moved: capture and the reconcile trigger
still run in the hook and it still returns no verdict; nothing is minted before
the model turn; the tools still resolve an authoritative origin and post into
the originating lane and nowhere else.
