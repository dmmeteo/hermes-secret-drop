"""S3 — ``bin/install-hermes-drop.sh``, exercised against a temp profile only.

Nothing here touches the operator's real profile: every invocation is handed a
``HERMES_HOME`` under ``tmp_path``, and ``test_isolation.py`` independently
asserts that the real one was never written. The installer is deliberately
never run against the live profile in S3 — that is S11/M2, behind an operator
gate.

The behaviours pinned are the ones that make rollback and audit possible
(plan §9): a symlink back to the repo so the repo stays the source of truth, a
timestamped config backup before any edit, ``plugins.enabled`` maintained
without ever writing ``allow_tool_override``, idempotence, and an
``--uninstall`` that is complete on its own.

Three of those changed with the independent review, and the tests below changed
with them:

* **M4 — the edit is surgical.** ``config.yaml`` is no longer round-tripped
  through ``yaml.safe_dump``, which destroyed every operator comment (21 → 0 on
  the live profile, and a 232-line diff for a one-line change). It is validated by
  a parser and edited by whole-line change instead
  (``bin/hermes-drop-config-edit.py``), and an ambiguous layout is **refused**
  rather than guessed at.
* **M4 — the install is transactional.** The config is validated and edited
  *before* anything is created, and a creation failure rolls the edit back. The
  old order — symlink first — left a half-install whenever the config step failed.
* **L6 — ``--uninstall`` performs the inverse edit, not a snapshot restore.** It
  removes exactly one entry from ``plugins.enabled``. It used to ``mv`` the newest
  backup over ``config.yaml``, which discarded every operator change made since
  install and resurrected the legacy plugin the install had retired. So
  "``--uninstall`` leaves config.yaml byte-identical to before install" is no
  longer the property under test — and asserting it was what kept the defect
  looking correct.
