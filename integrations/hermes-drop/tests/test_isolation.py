"""The isolation guard for this whole suite.

Everything else here imports hermes modules, boots plugin managers, and runs an
installer. Any one of those reaching the operator's real ``~/.hermes`` would be
a silent, durable side effect of running tests. This file makes that loud.

It is deliberately cheap and deliberately first-principles: it records the real
profile's mtimes at session start and re-checks them, rather than trusting that
every call site used ``get_hermes_home()``.
