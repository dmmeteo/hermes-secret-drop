"""S6 — the durable record, written before anything that depends on it.

The journal is the *only* durable thing in Drop. ``deliver_wake`` is best-effort
for five independently verified reasons (plan §3.3), so correctness cannot rest
on a wake landing. Everything here is therefore about two properties:

1. **A write either happened or it did not.** ``os.replace`` on a same-directory
   temp file, so a kill mid-write leaves the previous entry readable rather than
   a truncated one.
2. **Nothing secret is in it.** The field set is a closed allowlist and every
   string value is refused if it could carry a capability. §8.8: the capability
   appears exactly twice — the broker's ``create`` response and the chat message.

Claim authorisation lives here too, because it is a property of the durable
record and not of a live session: it binds the routing tuple
``(platform, profile, chat_id, thread_id, user_id)``, never ``session_key``, and
it must succeed with no wake having landed at all (§8.5, §3.3).
