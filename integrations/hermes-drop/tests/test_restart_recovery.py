"""S11 — restart recovery, end to end, across both languages.

Task 5 of the security MVP: ``create → broker restart → reconcile``. Everything
else in this suite pins one seam; this pins the *sequence*, because the failure
it is about only exists between the parts.

The sequence, and why each step is the real thing rather than a stand-in:

1. **create** — the production ``DropService`` with production defaults, so the
   journal is the ``$HERMES_HOME``-scoped one, the control client is the real
   AF_UNIX client, the socket path comes from ``HERMES_DROP_CONTROL_SOCKET``
   through the real config latch, and the waiter is the real ``REGISTRY``. It
   mints against this repo's actual Node broker (``broker_harness.mjs`` in
   ``--public`` mode, i.e. ``src/main.js``'s whole entry point).
2. **the gateway goes down** — the waiter is cancelled through the production
   ``WaiterRegistry.shutdown`` and the source registry is cleared. That is the
   documented consequence of a process exit: "a waiter lost to a process exit
   leaves its journal entry ``waiting``" (``drop/waiter.py``), and a restarted
   gateway knows no lanes until a conversation speaks.
3. **the user submits anyway** — through the real browser client
   (``src/client/handoff-client.js``), real HPKE, into a broker nobody is
   watching. This is what makes the claim assertions mean something: there *was*
   a secret, and it is the broker's in-memory copy that the restart destroys.
   It is deliberately *not* evidence about redaction — the drop is never claimed,
   so the plaintext never reaches this process at all. What this file can pin
   about the durable record is that the **capability**, which did pass through
   here, is not in it.
4. **the broker crashes** — SIGKILL, no shutdown hook, and its replacement boots
   on the same socket path because that is the only path the plugin has.
5. **reconcile** — through the production triggers, in production order: the
   startup poller finds the runner, then ``pre_gateway_dispatch``'s trigger fires
   once the lane is published again.

Two substitutions, both platform transport and nothing else:

* ``StubAdapter`` for the send/edit surface — real ``build_source`` provenance,
  no network, no bot credential (``_stubs.py``).
* ``announce._default_deliver`` for the wake, which would otherwise be
  ``gateway.wake.deliver_wake`` reaching into a live gateway. The reconciler,
  the journal, the messenger, the control client and the broker are all real.

**This test found a production bug** (fixed in the same change; see
``reconciler._note_deferred_pass``): the one-shot latch was consumed by the
startup pass even when that pass could not resolve a single lane, which after a
restart is the *normal* startup pass. The documented recovery — "an unresolvable
lane … becomes resolvable the moment that conversation speaks"
(``reconciler.origin_for_entry``) — could therefore never happen, and the drop
kept its ``waiting`` entry and its live-looking status message for the life of
the gateway process.
