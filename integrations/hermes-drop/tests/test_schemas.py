"""S4 — no destination field, at any depth.

"The model cannot express it" is the entire safety argument for initiation, so
it is asserted structurally rather than by reading the schema and agreeing that
it looks fine. The walk below descends through every dict key, every dict value,
and every list element of every schema.

Three schemas since the outbound direction landed, and the walk covers all three.
The argument is not weaker on ``SEND_PRIVATE_OUTPUT`` — it is stronger. A misrouted
inbound drop asks a stranger for a credential; a misrouted outbound one hands them
one, so the schema that hands things out is the last place a destination field could
be allowed to appear.

The one field that *sounds* like a destination and legitimately is not is
``purpose`` — a non-secret audit label — and ``minutes``, whose 1..60 range sits
inside the broker's ``maxTtlSeconds: 3600`` (``src/config.js:10``, not overridden
in ``compose.yml``).
