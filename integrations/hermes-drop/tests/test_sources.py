"""S4 — capturing and storing the REAL ``SessionSource``.

The premise, restated so the tests below read as consequences of it:
reconstructing a source from the bound contextvars is *provably* lossy in
exactly the fields that decide routing. ``_set_session_env`` propagates only
platform / chat_id / chat_type / chat_name / thread_id / user_id / user_name /
session_key / message_id / profile (``gateway/run.py:20255-20269``). It omits
``scope_id`` — so ``_thread_metadata_for_source`` cannot derive
``slack_team_id`` (``gateway/platforms/base.py:78-83``) — omits
``parent_chat_id``/``chat_id_alt``/``user_id_alt``, and cannot carry
``delivered_via_upstream_relay``, which is deliberately excluded from
``to_dict`` (``gateway/session.py:194-206``) and is exactly what
the gateway's adapter resolution keys relay delivery off
(``gateway/authz_mixin.py``). A hand-built source also has no
``_transport_adapter_ref``, so ``_registered_transport_adapter`` returns
``None`` (``:128-149``).

Hence: capture the real object, store it, and never rebuild one.

── ContextVar propagation, resolved against actual ``copy_context`` behaviour ──

The plan asserts a plugin ContextVar "propagates into the worker thread with no
core change". That is true, and it is only true in one direction. The three
tests below pin all three directions, because the design depends on knowing
which is which:

1. **Forward, into a snapshot.** ``invoke_hook`` calls ``ret = cb(**kwargs)``
   directly and synchronously (``hermes_cli/plugins.py:1933`` via
   ``hermes_cli/lifecycle.py:11-22``), so a ``.set()`` inside the callback
   mutates ``_handle_message``'s own context. ``_run_in_executor_with_context``
   later snapshots with ``copy_context()`` and runs ``ctx.run`` on the worker
   (``gateway/run.py:20276-20285``). The value is in the snapshot. ✔

2. **Backward, out of a snapshot: NO.** ``copy_context`` is a *copy*. A
   ``.set()`` performed inside ``ctx.run`` — or inside a child task — is
   invisible to the caller. This is the reason ``SourceRegistry`` exists at all:
   a context-local alone cannot carry a source from one turn to a later one, so
   the cross-turn path has to be an ordinary module-level store.

3. **Sideways, by inheritance: YES, and that is the hazard.**
   ``asyncio.create_task`` snapshots the *current* context, so a task spawned
   while a concurrent turn had already set ``_TURN_SOURCE`` inherits that
   foreign source. For non-internal events our own callback overwrites it within
   a few statements; for **internal** events the callback never runs
   (``gateway/run.py:13633``), so the inherited value can survive a whole wake
   turn. That is the same failure class ``reset_session_vars`` exists for
   (``gateway/session_context.py:260-305``), and it is why §4's verification is
   mandatory rather than defensive — see ``test_origin.py``.
