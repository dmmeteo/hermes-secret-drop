// In-memory handoff broker.
//
// Invariants this module owns:
//   - the capability itself is never stored, only SHA-256(capability);
//   - the per-handoff P-256 private key is non-extractable and lives only here;
//   - state transitions pending -> submitted -> claimed happen synchronously, so
//     exactly one submit and exactly one claim can win in a single Node process;
//   - a claimed handoff keeps a payload-free receipt until its TTL, so an
//     identical retry is answered idempotently instead of looking unavailable;
//   - missing, malformed, expired and consumed handoffs are indistinguishable
//     *by response content*: every failure is the same
//     `{ ok: false, error: 'unavailable' }`. This is a content invariant, not a
//     timing one — `waitForSubmission` blocks for a live pending handoff and
//     returns at once for every other state, so it deliberately leaks liveness
//     by timing. That is acceptable only because it is reachable solely through
//     the 0600 admin socket, by a caller already trusted with the plaintext,
//     and because handoff ids are public by design;
//   - nothing here logs, returns or serializes plaintext except `claim()`, whose
//     bytes go straight to the local admin CLI's stdout, and `beginFileClaim()`,
//     which hands container views to the local streamer;
//   - `claim()` never consumes a payload it cannot hand over: a caller that
//     declares how much it can receive is refused *before* the retirement, so a
//     reader too small for the answer costs a refusal rather than the secret.
//
// The transfer lease (docs/FILE_TRANSFER_MVP.md, slice 3). A `files` payload is
// too large to hand over in one answer, so its claim is two operations with a
// stream between them, and the state machine grows the substate that makes that
// lossless:
//
//   submitted --beginFileClaim--> transferring --commitFileClaim--> claimed
//                                      |
//                                      +-- disconnect, lease timeout, failed
//                                          commit --> submitted
//
// Three rules make it lossless rather than merely two-phase:
//
//   ONE      at most one lease per handoff, taken and released inside a
//            synchronous gate, so concurrent receivers cannot both stream.
//   OWNED    the lease belongs to an `owner` token the caller supplies — the
//            control server passes its per-connection session object, so the
//            lease is the connection and there is nothing to forge. Knowing a
//            transfer id buys nothing.
//   COMMIT   the retirement happens in `commitFileClaim` and nowhere else, only
//            after the receiver has acknowledged every frame with a digest that
//            matches the manifest. Frames go out one at a time and each one has to be
//            acked before the next is written, so "the receiver has the bytes" does
//            not depend on the socket send buffer — see `ackFileClaimFrame`. Every
//            other outcome is a refusal that leaves the payload `submitted` and
//            one-shot.
//
// A lease holds its live-file reservation for its whole duration, which is why
// the lease has a bounded deadline: an abandoned transfer must not be able to
// hold a quarter of the process budget until the TTL lapses.
//
// Payload kinds (docs/FILE_TRANSFER_MVP.md, slice 2). A handoff is minted as
// `text` — one UTF-8 secret under `maxPlaintextBytes`, envelope v1, unchanged in
// every respect — or as `files`, which carries one HDROP2 container under the
// file limits and envelope v2. The kind decides three things that must never be
// decided freely by the submitter: which envelope version the broker will rebuild
// `info` with, which ceiling the ciphertext is measured against, and whether the
// decrypted bytes must parse as a container before the record may reach
// `submitted`.
//
// The universal drop (docs/UNIVERSAL_DROP_DELIVERY_PLAN.md, U1). A third kind is
// minted without that choice made — `pending(choice)` — because the sender, not
// the requester, decides in the browser:
//
//   pending(choice)
//     ├─ accepted v1 text  → submitted(text)
//     └─ accepted v2 files → submitted(files)
//
// Two rules keep that from handing the submitter the three decisions above:
//
//   DECLARE  one submission says which lane it is *before* its body is read, in a
//            non-secret request header next to the capability. The broker resolves
//            that declaration to a kind once, and every ceiling, version and
//            validation rule for that request comes from the resolution — never
//            from the envelope's own `v`, which is a claim, not an authority.
//   BIND     the resolved kind's version goes into `info`, so a declaration and a
//            ciphertext that disagree cannot open. A mismatch is refused before any
//            crypto, and neither the drop nor the AEAD budget pays for it.
//
// A universal record's kind is fixed by the winning submission, in the same
// synchronous step that stores the payload, and is immutable afterwards: from
// `submitted` onward it is indistinguishable from a drop minted that way, which is
// what lets `claim`, `beginFileClaim` and every other seam stay as they were. A
// competing submission of the other kind then reads as a declaration that
// contradicts a fixed kind, i.e. the same uniform `unavailable` as any second
// submission.
//
// The live-file byte budget, in one place because every release has to agree
// with it:
//
//   RESERVE  a drop minted as `files` takes one reservation in `create`,
//            synchronously, before its first await. Refused when it does not fit,
//            with the same uniform `unavailable` as everything else.
//   LEASE    a *universal* drop reserves nothing at creation — it may never carry
//            a file at all, and four idle text-capable links must not exhaust the
//            budget. Its reservation is taken by the `files` declaration in
//            `acquireSubmitSlot`, before a byte of the body is buffered, and it
//            converts into the reservation above in the same synchronous step that
//            fixes the kind. Every other ending — refusal, abort, deadline, expiry,
//            shutdown — gives it back.
//   HOLD     `submit` does not release. From submit onward the broker really is
//            holding those bytes, so releasing there would let the process
//            exceed the budget it enforced at create.
//   RELEASE  exactly once, at the record's first terminal event — the retirement
//            a claim performs, or `destroy` for expiry, a spent failure budget
//            and shutdown. A claimed receipt holds no payload and no reservation.
//
// The reservation is the largest plaintext the drop could ever hold — the whole
// container ceiling, header and manifest included — never the actual size, which
// is unknown until submit. Bounding the worst case is the entire point, so the
// reservation has to *be* the worst case rather than most of it.
//
// What the budget does NOT cover, stated because the number invites the opposite
// reading: it bounds *resident payload* bytes only. One submission in flight costs
// several times its payload transiently — a buffered base64 body, that body as a
// JS string, the ciphertext string `JSON.parse` produces, the decoded ciphertext
// and the plaintext — and none of that is charged here. It is bounded instead by
// admitting at most one widened body per drop (`acquireSubmitSlot`), which caps
// concurrent submission-path allocation at one in-flight upload per live file
// drop. Removing that gate would make this budget's guarantee false, not merely
// loose: the de-duplication in `submit` engages only after a body is already whole
// in memory, so nothing else on the path limits buffering.
