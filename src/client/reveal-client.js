// Browser-facing reveal client: the exact code the page runs to open an outbound
// drop (docs/OUTBOUND_SECRET_DROP_MVP.md). Kept free of DOM references, like its
// inbound counterpart in src/client/handoff-client.js, so tests and the smoke run
// can drive the real client logic from Node.
//
// Rules encoded here:
//   - the capability travels in a request header, never in a path or query, and the
//     decryption key travels in neither: it comes out of the fragment and is used
//     only by `crypto.subtle` in this process;
//   - the code is sent only on the claim, which is the one state-changing request. A
//     GET, a HEAD or a metadata fetch never carries it and never claims;
//   - one claimant is one claim id, drawn here and reused for every retry of the
//     same reveal. A fresh id would be a second claimant and would be refused;
//   - the payload is decrypted locally, and the acknowledgement that destroys it on
//     the broker is sent only *after* a successful decryption — an ack before that
//     would destroy a payload this page could not read.
