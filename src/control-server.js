/**
 * One connection, from accept to close.
 *
 * Nearly every op on this socket is one line in, one line out, then closed. The
 * file claim is the exception and the reason this function exists: it is a
 * *conversation* — a begin, a metadata line, length-framed binary, a commit, an
 * answer — and it has to be one connection rather than two round trips, because
 * the connection is the lease.
 *
 * Three things follow from that and are all here rather than in the broker:
 *
 *   PHASE   what the connection will accept next. A commit is only ever accepted
 *           in `awaiting_commit`, which is reachable only by having personally
 *           begun the transfer and streamed all of it. A caller that learns a
 *           handoff id and a transfer id therefore still cannot commit: there is
 *           no phase it can present them in.
 *   ORDER   data events are processed through one promise chain. Without it a
 *           commit line pipelined behind the begin could be handled while the
 *           frames were still going out, and the "every advertised byte was
 *           flushed" check would be racing the writes it is about.
 *   RELEASE the lease is given back however the connection ends — a refusal, an
 *           error, a client that hangs up mid-frame, a process that dies. That is
 *           what makes a failed transfer cost a refusal instead of a payload.
 *
 * The `session` object is also the lease's owner token. Its identity is the
 * authorization: it never leaves this closure, so no other connection can present
 * it and nothing on the wire can imitate it.
