// The one chat message a drop costs, and the three states it is edited through.
//
// Variant A: Hermes posts `waitingNotice` with `send_message(action="send")`,
// keeps the `message_id` that comes back, and then *edits that same message* —
// to `receivedNotice()` when the browser submits, or `expiredNotice()` when the
// link lapses. The message is never deleted and never joined by a status
// sibling; the substantive answer to the payload is a separate ordinary reply.
//
// The send and the edit both go through the **origin adapter** —
// `adapter.send(...)` and `adapter.edit_message(..., finalize=True)` on the
// adapter that owns the originating conversation (`drop/messenger.py`). There is
// no raw REST call and no bot credential resolution anywhere in the delivered
// design: the earlier plan to `PATCH /channels/{id}/messages/{id}` with the
// active profile's token (research 09) is **superseded** by §2/§7.1, and dropping
// it is the plan's largest security win — no token is read, so none can leak.
//
// EVERY RENDERER HERE EMITS STANDARD MARKDOWN, and that is a transport
// requirement rather than a style choice. Both verified adapters run
// `format_message(content)` over the string before posting it:
//
//   - Telegram posts with `parse_mode=ParseMode.MARKDOWN_V2` and translates a
//     standard Markdown link into a MarkdownV2 one, `**bold**` into `*bold*`,
//     and a backticked span into a protected code span
//     (`plugins/platforms/telegram/adapter.py:7480-7650`, the send at `:4450`).
//     HTML has no meaning there: `<b>` is escaped to a literal `<b>` and
//     *displayed*, which is how the pre-fix HTML notice put the whole capability
//     URL in plain view (review H1). Nothing selects a parse mode from the
//     `metadata` dict the messenger builds, so Markdown is the only shape that
//     renders.
//   - Discord's `format_message` is a table-to-bullets pass and otherwise a
//     passthrough (`plugins/platforms/discord/adapter.py:5197-5205`).
//
// EVERY VERIFIED-PLATFORM STATE IS A BLOCKQUOTE CARD — a `> ` prefix on every
// line — and that is the whole of "native rendering" here. It is the one rich
// construct both verified adapters render *natively* through the interface the
// plugin actually has:
//
//   - Telegram: `format_message` step 9 turns a leading `>` into a native
//     MarkdownV2 blockquote (`telegram/adapter.py:4959-4966`), and both paths the
//     messenger uses carry it — `send()` posts `parse_mode=MARKDOWN_V2`, and
//     `edit_message(..., finalize=True)` re-runs `format_message` before editing
//     (`:3491`). So the card survives the lifecycle edit, not just the send.
//     The *expandable* form (`**>` … `||`) is deliberately NOT used: step 5's
//     bold regex runs before step 9 and eats the `**` prefix, and the `||`
//     terminator only closes on a single line — the result is corrupt markup.
//   - Discord renders `>` as a blockquote client-side, and its `format_message`
//     returns these strings byte-identical.
//
// A DISCORD EMBED IS NOT REACHABLE FROM A PLUGIN, which is why the accent-colour
// design this shape replaces was not built. `DiscordAdapter.send` calls
// `channel.send(content=…)` and `edit_message` calls `msg.edit(content=…)`; the
// adapter contract types the payload as `content: str`
// (`gateway/platforms/base.py:2399,:2412`) and Discord reads only `thread_id`
// and `notify` out of `metadata`. The adapter's own embeds live in private
// fixed-shape prompt builders that all attach a `discord.ui.View` and have no
// embed-carrying *edit* counterpart, so an embed could not survive a state
// transition even if one could be sent. Accent colour on Discord exists only on
// embeds, so the state signal here is the glyph and the label instead.
//
// The renderer × real-`format_message` seam is pinned by
// integrations/hermes-drop/tests/test_notice_adapter_seam.py, which formats a
// notice minted by this module through both real adapters and asserts the
// capability never reaches the visible layer. Nothing in the JS suite can check
// that — it is a cross-language property.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing and are pinned by
// test/hermes-wake-contract.test.js:
//
//   - The link is a *masked Markdown link*, on both verified platforms. Discord
//     builds no embed for one, and the capability lives in the `#fragment`,
//     which no unfurler would fetch anyway — a fragment is never sent to the
//     server. Telegram may still build a preview for the *base* URL (the plugin
//     cannot suppress it: `_link_preview_kwargs` is adapter-wide config, not a
//     per-message `metadata` key), and that preview carries no fragment.
//   - Discord's deadline is a *relative timestamp*, `<t:UNIX:R>`. Discord
//     re-renders "in 29 minutes" client-side, so the countdown costs zero API
//     calls. A duration baked into the text would go stale within a minute and
//     invite exactly the per-minute edit loop this design rules out. Telegram
//     re-renders nothing, so it gets an absolute UTC deadline instead.
//
// The received and expired states are deliberately bare: no URL, no capability,
// no timestamp, not even the handoff id — by then there is nothing left to look
// up, and a quiet line is the whole point. Routing stays in the journal rather
// than exposing transport metadata in the user-facing notice. They keep the `> `
// card so the lifecycle edit *replaces* the waiting card rather than collapsing
// it into loose prose, and they stay platform-independent constants (zero
// arguments, byte-identical everywhere) because the journal caches both strings
// at create time so a waiter that outlives a gateway restart can edit without a
// broker round trip (`drop/journal.py:295-299`). That is also why `plain`
// receives the same two strings: a per-platform quiet state would have to take
// an argument, and the export surface is pinned to three zero-argument states.
