// The one chat message an *outbound* drop costs: a link, a code, a deadline, and
// what "one reveal" means (docs/OUTBOUND_SECRET_DROP_MVP.md, "Approved UX").
//
// Its own module rather than a fourth renderer in src/notice.js, because that
// module's export surface is pinned to its three inbound states
// (test/hermes-wake-contract.test.js) — and because these two messages say opposite
// things. An inbound notice asks for a secret and is *edited* through three states as
// the drop resolves. An outbound notice hands one over and is never edited at all:
// there is no submission to report, and the only event after it is a reveal the
// broker deliberately cannot attribute to a conversation. One post, no follow-up.
//
// EVERY RENDERER HERE EMITS STANDARD MARKDOWN, for the transport reason spelled out
// at length in src/notice.js: both verified adapters run `format_message` over the
// string, Telegram posts MarkdownV2, and an HTML tag would be escaped and *displayed*
// — capability and all (review H1).
//
// The verified platforms get the same `> ` blockquote card as the inbound states, so
// "Hermes is handing you a secret" reads as one visually distinct block rather than
// four loose lines — see src/notice.js for why a blockquote is the one rich construct
// reachable here and why a Discord embed is not. Two shape constraints, both verified
// against the real adapters rather than assumed:
//
//   - Every line carries the prefix. A bare `>` separator line does NOT work: the
//     MarkdownV2 blockquote rule needs `> ` plus content, so a lone `>` escapes to a
//     literal `\>` *and* splits the card into two blockquotes. The lines are therefore
//     contiguous, with no blank line inside the card. `plain` keeps its blank line,
//     having no card to break.
//   - The access code stays a backticked span *inside* the quote; placeholder
//     protection runs before blockquote conversion, so the code span survives intact
//     and stays tappable-to-copy.
//
// NOTHING MODEL-SUPPLIED REACHES THIS TEXT, and that is the load-bearing rule of the
// module rather than an accident of what it happens to render. The payload's `title`
// and its field labels are strings a model composed, and this message is Markdown
// going to a platform that renders links: a "title" of
// `x](https://evil.test) [click here` forges a link in the conversation, and escaping
// it correctly for MarkdownV2 *and* for whatever the adapter's own `format_message`
// then does to it is exactly the double-translation that review H1 was. So nothing
// from the payload reaches the notice. Labels and titles render on the *page*, where
// they are `textContent` and cannot be markup at all (src/client/reveal-view.js).
//
// The code goes in the same message as the link, which the MVP approves and which its
// own security note is honest about: the code is a human-presence and anti-preview
// gate, not a second factor, precisely because the two travel together. What it buys
// is that an unfurler, a scanner or an antivirus fetching the URL cannot consume the
// drop. It is emitted as a backticked span so that it survives MarkdownV2 as a
// protected code span, is unambiguous about its leading zeros, and is tappable to
// copy on both verified platforms.
