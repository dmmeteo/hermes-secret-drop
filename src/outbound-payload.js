// The structured outbound payload: what a revealed drop actually contains, and the
// bounds outside which nothing is minted at all.
//
// An outbound drop hands a *person* a credential, and a credential is almost never
// one string: it is a login and a password, or a key and the console it belongs to,
// or a token and a note about rotating it. So the payload is JSON with a list of
// labelled fields and the reveal page renders however many it finds — one, or five,
// or eight (src/client/reveal-view.js).
//
// That makes this module the boundary where an object composed by a *model* crosses
// into a page a user is about to trust, and every rule below exists because of that
// sentence rather than because JSON needs a schema:
//
//   CLOSED SETS      the version, the field types and the generator kinds are
//                    enumerations. A value outside one is refused, never coerced and
//                    never carried through as "some other kind of field" — the page
//                    would then have to decide what to do with it, and the safe
//                    decision is the one made here.
//   SENSITIVE BY     a field with no type, or a type this bundle does not know, is
//   DEFAULT          sensitive. Showing a secret in the clear is the mistake that
//                    cannot be taken back, so the default has to be the mask.
//   NO CONTROL       labels and values are checked for control characters, format
//   CHARACTERS       characters and line/paragraph separators. Not because they
//                    would break the rendering — the page writes `textContent`, so
//                    they cannot — but because a right-to-left override inside a
//                    label makes "Note" render as "Password" next to a value the
//                    user is about to paste somewhere. The page can render text
//                    safely; it cannot render *honestly* if the text lies about its
//                    own direction.
//   BOUNDED SUM      each label, each value, the field count *and the canonical
//                    whole* are bounded. Bounding only the parts is how a payload
//                    every field of which is legal gets minted and then cannot be
//                    sent, because the control request line it has to fit inside is
//                    4096 bytes (src/control-server.js).
//   ATOMIC REFUSAL   a payload is valid or it is nothing. There is no partial
//                    acceptance, no dropped field and no truncated value: a drop
//                    that silently delivered four of five credentials would be
//                    worse than one that refused, because the user cannot tell.
//   REASONS ARE      a refusal comes back as a code from a closed set and never as
//   CODES            prose containing the input. The reason travels to a caller
//                    whose results reach a model's context and from there durable
//                    session state (integrations/hermes-drop/drop/vault.py), so a
//                    reason quoting the offending value would put the secret in the
//                    one place this whole project exists to keep it out of.
//
// Isomorphic, like src/outbound-envelope.js and for the same reason: the broker
// validates on the way in and the page validates on the way out. Nothing here
// imports Node — `crypto.getRandomValues` is the one platform call, and it is
// present in both.
